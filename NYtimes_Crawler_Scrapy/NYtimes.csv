"Robert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his “A.I. dudes.” The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield.
Last spring, he asked, “O.K., you guys are the smartest guys in A.I., right?”
No, the dudes told him, “the smartest guys are at Facebook and Google,” Mr. Work recalled in an interview.
Now, increasingly, they’re also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare.
The Pentagon’s plan to bring A.I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies.
Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech.
Although they boasted that they had outperformed their United States competitors, a well-known A.I. researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently 
 Microsoft, noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier.
That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.
First announced last year by 
, President Barack Obama’s defense secretary, the “Third Offset” strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia.
Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in 
. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation’s leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons.
But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls.
In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon’s ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today’s new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees.
As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation’s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence.
The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Qi Lu, a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, 
 to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the company’s ambitious plan to become a global leader in A.I.
And last year, Tencent, developer of the mobile app WeChat, a Facebook competitor, 
 and began investing in United States-based A.I. companies.
Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field.
“The Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,” said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations.
In August, the state-run China Daily 
 that the country had embarked on the development of a cruise missile system with a “high level” of artificial intelligence. The new system appears to be a response to a missile the United States Navy is expected to deploy in 2018 to counter growing Chinese military influence in the Pacific.
Known as the 
, or L.R.A.S.M., it is described as a “semiautonomous” weapon. According to the Pentagon, this means that though targets are chosen by human soldiers, the missile uses artificial intelligence technology to avoid defenses and make final targeting decisions.
The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as “remote warfare,” said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers.
“They are making their machines more creative,” he said. “A little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost.”
Whether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States.
Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition.
“There are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,” he said. “But then U.S. media reports only on the U.S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U.S.”
A key example of Chinese progress that goes largely unreported in the United States is 
, an artificial intelligence company that has focused on speech recognition and understanding natural language. The company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between Chinese- and English-language texts.
The company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a “Humanoid Answering Robot.”
“Our goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,” said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek’s chief executive.
The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel’s laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal — taking a demonstration to the 
 in Las Vegas — after just nine months of work.
“The A.I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed,” Mr. Wu said. “We wrote every line by ourselves.”
Their first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis.
The United States’ view of China’s advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here.
Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A.I. a priority in its military systems.
“I think while China is definitely making progress in A.I. systems, it is nowhere close to matching the U.S.,” said 
, a former Indian military officer who is now a naval weapons analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.
Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view.
“It is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A.I., and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoft’s and Google’s China-based research laboratories.
Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A.I. both in the United States and in China.
“Using a chess analogy,” he said, “we might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level A.I. scientists.”
What is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A.I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China.
In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu’s Silicon Valley A.I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses.
One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom.
Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly.
Last year, China also brought the world’s fastest supercomputer, the 
, online, supplanting another Chinese model that had been the world’s fastest. The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation, a shift from its role as a manufacturing hub for components and devices designed in the United States and elsewhere.
In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intel’s Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing.
The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets.
But similar advances in high-performance computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with machine-learning research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries.
Moreover, while there appear to be relatively cozy relationships between the Chinese government and commercial technology efforts, the same cannot be said about the United States. The Pentagon recently restarted its beachhead in Silicon Valley, known as the 
, or DIUx. It is an attempt to rethink bureaucratic United States government contracting practices in terms of the faster and more fluid style of Silicon Valley.
The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency’s surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China’s market.
“There are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that they’re going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir,” said Peter W. Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the Palo Alto, Calif., start-up founded in part by the venture capitalist 
. “But if you’re thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they can’t become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market.”
Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley.
“No one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can’t say it’s about China, and the tech companies can’t,” Mr. Singer said. “But it’s there in the background.”",China’s Intelligent Weaponry Gets Smarter,"FEB. 3, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/technology/artificial-intelligence-china-united-states.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,JOHN MARKOFF
"WASHINGTON — When President Trump took a phone call from the leader of Taiwan in December and asserted that the United States might no longer be bound by the “One China” policy, his defenders hailed it as a show of strength — the latest delicate issue on which Mr. Trump was willing to challenge decades of diplomatic orthodoxy.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump fell back into line. In a call with President 
 of China, he pledged fealty to One China, a 44-year-old policy under which the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Mr. Trump has also tacked to the center on Israel. After presenting himself as a stalwart defender of Prime Minister 
 who would buck the pressure campaign against Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Mr. Trump warned Israelis this week that he did not believe that “going ahead with these settlements is a good thing for peace.”
And on Iran, where Mr. Trump threatened as a candidate to rip up the nuclear deal struck by President Barack Obama, advisers to the new president told the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Federica Mogherini, that the United States would fully carry out the agreement.
As Mr. Trump begins to shape his foreign policy, he is proving to be less of a radical than either his campaign statements or his tempestuous early phone calls with foreign leaders would suggest. On Friday, as he welcomed Prime Minister 
 of Japan to the White House, Mr. Trump characterized America’s alliance with Japan as a “cornerstone of peace and stability.” Those time-tested words bore little resemblance to his threats during the campaign to mothball the partnership.
“Every president discovers that it looks different from the perspective of the Oval Office than it did on the campaign trail,” said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution. “The fact that President Trump is proving flexible on some key foreign policy issues suggests he’s less ideologically driven than his early moves would imply.”
To some extent, Mr. Trump is simply undergoing the same evolution that all of his predecessors went through. Mr. Obama, who ran as an antiwar candidate, became an avid user of drone strikes and other covert counterterrorism operations pioneered by George W. Bush.
In Mr. Trump’s case, however, the recalibration is starker because of the extreme nature of the positions he had staked out on issues like China, Russia and the NATO alliance, as well as the Trump campaign’s thin ranks of policy advisers and his slowness in assembling a full national security team in the White House. It also stands in stark contrast to his more uncompromising approach on other matters like the legal challenges to his executive order on immigration.
“He made it all the way to inauguration without doing the deep-dive policy reviews and internal debates that every other successful administration does during the campaign and the transition,” said Peter D. Feaver, who served in Mr. Bush’s National Security Council.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, administration officials said, was among those who urged Mr. Trump to publicly endorse the One China policy as a way to defuse tensions with Mr. Xi. Before Thursday, the two leaders had not spoken since Nov. 14; administration officials said that the Chinese leader would not get on the phone with Mr. Trump without assurances from the administration that he would commit to the policy.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has also emerged as an influential player, officials said. He recently returned from a trip to Asia during which he offered reassurances of American support for allies like Japan and South Korea. Among his travel companions was Matthew Pottinger, who recently became the senior director for Asia in the National Security Council.
“There finally is an administration beginning to take shape around him, which there was not before — Tillerson and Mattis in particular,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former top China adviser to Mr. Obama. “During the transition, no one had the nerve or expertise to contradict him.”
In addition to his cabinet officers, Mr. Trump and his aides are beginning to soak up advice from other leaders. The president stiffened his tone on settlements after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan; his advisers, including Jared Kushner, spoke with Arab officials, who urged the administration not to give Israel a free hand on the issue.
In an interview with an Israeli newspaper, Israel Hayom, which was published on Friday, Mr. Trump said settlements “don’t help the process” — a phrase that is not substantially different from those used by Mr. Obama or Mr. Bush.
“Every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left,” Mr. Trump continued.
When the White House issued an initial statement on settlements last week, some analysts read its ambiguous wording as leaving Israel plenty of room for maneuvering. It said that settlements were not an impediment to peace, but that they “may not be helpful.” Mr. Trump’s remarks were more pointed, however, and experts said they suggested a genuine shift.
“The right-wingers who looked at him like he was going to be the master builder of the Middle East — that was not warranted,” said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “The more he immerses himself in this, he will see there are conflicting pressures and realities. He is going to have to navigate within those constraints.”
The White House’s pledge to carry out the Iran nuclear deal does not reflect a change of heart on Tehran. The administration last week imposed new sanctions on Iran for its launching of a ballistic missile. But officials in the White House are more focused on curbing what they see as a pattern of aggressive behavior by Iran from Syria to Yemen.
Mr. Trump’s retreat on One China, experts said, also should be seen in a regional context. He offered the concession to Mr. Xi on the eve of a three-day visit by Mr. Abe, during which the Japanese leader had lunch at the White House and is Mr. Trump’s guest at Mar-a-Lago, where they and their wives are having dinner, and the two men are playing golf at a nearby club.
To allow the tensions between China and the United States to fester during such a prominent display of hospitality to the Japanese, analysts said, would have further poisoned relations between Washington and Beijing. At his news conference with Mr. Abe, Mr. Trump took pains to say he and Mr. Xi were developing their own rapport.
“It was a very, very warm conversation,” Mr. Trump said. “I think we are in the process of getting along very well, and I think that we’ll also be very much of a benefit to Japan.”
Mr. Abe appeared pleased, too, noting that the president had reaffirmed the American security guarantee to Japan, including over what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by both Japan and China. That was a far cry from Mr. Trump’s suggestion during the campaign that the United States might walk away from the alliance.
Michael J. Green, an Asia director in Mr. Bush’s National Security Council, noted that in the weeks before Mr. Trump took office, he suggested that the key pillars of America’s relationship with both China and Japan — the One China policy and the mutual defense treaty — would both be on the table, chips to be used in a broader negotiation.
“What’s been so interesting about the last few days is that Trump took both issues off the table,” Mr. Green said. “You can hear the sigh of relief across the whole Asia-Pacific region.”",Trump Foreign Policy Quickly Loses Its Sharp Edge,"FEB. 10, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy-quickly-loses-its-sharp-edge.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,MARK LANDLER
"BEIJING — President Trump may not be known for his diplomacy, but someone in his family appears to be picking up the slack.
That would be Arabella, his 5-year-old granddaughter. A 
” in Chinese has gone viral on social media in 
. Arabella has been taking Chinese lessons.
Arabella’s mother, Ivanka Trump, posted the song on her Instagram account on Thursday. “Arabella singing a song she learned for #ChineseNewYear. Wishing everyone an amazing year to come during these days of celebration,” Ms. Trump wrote on her account.
Arabella appeared in a black cardigan with ornate pockets and skinny black pants, and she played with a Chinese marionette as she sang.
On Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, more than 60,000 people said they liked Arabella’s song. Some of them said they much preferred her to Mr. Trump, who has stirred the 
 and the South China Sea, among other things.
“The granddaughter is much more sensible,” said one. Another Weibo user noted, “Her Mandarin is perfect.” Some people were more critical: “So you want to get the Chinese off your back with just this song?”
However, this was not Arabella’s first diplomatic coup this week. On Wednesday evening, she and her mother turned up at a New Year’s reception at the Chinese Embassy in Washington.
A beaming Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, escorted the pair around the party, as Arabella, decked out in red dress with a big bow at her neck, played with Chinese traditional arts that were on display.
China’s official broadcaster, CCTV, showed the mother-and-daughter team at the reception on its prime-time news broadcast on Thursday.
The usually stern state-run newspaper Global Times almost gushed. “Her appearance at the Chinese Embassy, endowed with a certain political and diplomatic significance, could be invigorating to the China-U.S. relationship,” the paper said of Ms. Trump’s embassy visit, with Arabella in tow.","Trump’s Granddaughter, 5, Sings in Chinese, and China Swoons","FEB. 3, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/world/asia/arabella-kushner-ivanka-trump-china-song.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,JANE PERLEZ
"BEIJING — 
 reacted with strong displeasure on Saturday to a promise by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis that the United States would defend two uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that 
 controls but China also claims as its own.
Mr. Mattis, the first member of President Trump’s cabinet to visit East Asia, had 
 that America’s defense obligations to Japan extended to the disputed rocky outposts, known in China as the Diaoyu and in Japan as the Senkaku.
The chief spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, accused Mr. Mattis of putting regional stability at risk and urged him to forgo what he called a Cold War mentality.
“We urge the U.S. side to take a responsible attitude, stop making wrong remarks on the issue involving the Diaoyu islands’ sovereignty, and avoid making the issue more complicated and bringing instability to the regional situation,” Mr. Lu said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.
He described the 1960 defense treaty between the United States and Japan, which Mr. Mattis cited in pledging to defend the islands, as a “product of the Cold War, which should not impair China’s territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights.”
Mr. Mattis was not staking out a new American position; while in office, President Barack Obama said that the United States would defend the islands.
But the defense secretary’s words were reassuring to Japanese officials, who had been unnerved by Mr. Trump’s remarks as a presidential candidate suggesting that he might reduce America’s military commitments to its Asian allies.
The disputed islands have been among a number of potential points of contention as China builds up its presence in the East and South China Seas.
Chinese and Japanese vessels regularly maneuver at close quarters in the waters as China tries to challenge Japan’s control of the islands.
Last year, China sent a warship to within 24 miles of the islands. President 
 of China declared much of the East China Sea to be a Chinese air defense zone in 2013, and since then China has regularly sent fighter jets to patrol the area.
, Mr. Mattis cited Article 5 of the United States-Japan treaty, which commits the United States to defend Japan or territories that it administers against attack.
“I made clear that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands stands — the U.S. will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands,” Mr. Mattis said. “And as such, Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security treaty applies.”
Before going to Japan, Mr. Mattis went to South Korea to 
 about defense commitments, and China’s reaction was similar.
Mr. Lu struck a strident tone on Friday in expressing China’s opposition to American plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea, one that Mr. Mattis said was intended to protect the country from 
’s nuclear threat.
“We firmly oppose” the deployment, Mr. Lu said at a regular news briefing. “This will not change and has not changed.” The system, which China says is an American attempt to interfere with China’s nuclear deterrent, “will undermine the strategic balance,” he said.
China has threatened South Korea with economic consequences if it agrees to the deployment of the system, known as Thaad, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.
With the South Korean government in disarray and a presidential election coming there, the Chinese government has been wooing the opposition Minjoo Party, which opposes the Thaad deployment.
Officials of that left-leaning party have visited Beijing twice in recent months, offering reassurances that they oppose the system.
, China’s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, spoke by telephone with Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, the Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
The conversation, which the ministry said was initiated by the White House, appeared to be a preparatory step for a call between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump.
The ministry’s account of the conversation was upbeat. Mr. Flynn said the United States was committed to “developing strong and powerful U.S.-China relations” and “properly managing the sensitive issues,” the ministry said. For his part, Mr. Yang emphasized the two countries’ “broad common interests and great cooperation potential,” according to the ministry.
Mr. Trump criticized China on a variety of fronts during the presidential transition, but the White House has had little to say about the country during the president’s first two weeks in office.
And although Mr. Trump has held phone conversations from the Oval Office, several of them stormy, with a variety of world leaders, Mr. Xi has not been among them.
There has been speculation among diplomats in Beijing and among American business groups in Washington that the two leaders would talk by phone in the coming days.
Mr. Yang and Mr. Flynn last spoke in New York, a month after the presidential election, and from Mr. Yang’s point of view the meeting was not helpful.
Just two days later, Mr. Trump astounded the Chinese government by asserting that the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, was far from sacrosanct.
“I don’t know 
 unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,” Mr. Trump said on Fox News.
Although there was no indication that Mr. Trump was reacting to anything Mr. Yang had said to Mr. Flynn, the episode was embarrassing for the Chinese official so soon after their meeting.
Earlier in December, Mr. Trump upended decades of American diplomatic practice by speaking with Taiwan’s president by telephone. The Chinese have since stressed on several occasions that the One China policy is not negotiable.
The Foreign Ministry’s statement on the conversation on Friday between Mr. Yang and Mr. Flynn did not say whether the two had discussed Taiwan, only that they had discussed regional affairs.",China Assails U.S. Pledge to Defend Disputed Islands Controlled by Japan,"FEB. 4, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/china-us-jim-mattis-japan-islands.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,JANE PERLEZ
"TOKYO — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described 
 as the world’s greatest sponsor of terrorism on Saturday, but he emphasized that there was no pressing need for the United States to beef up its military presence in the Persian Gulf region.
“I do not see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the Middle East at this time,” Mr. Mattis said, speaking in Tokyo at a news conference as he wound up his visits to 
 and 
, his first foreign trip as defense secretary.
Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s national security adviser, said this week that the United States was 
 because of its recent missile test and support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, whom the United States has accused of threatening American vessels in the Red Sea and attacking a Saudi Navy patrol boat.
The Trump administration imposed economic sanctions on Friday against 25 Iranians and companies that it said were connected with Iran’s missile program and the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But so far, the White House has not announced military steps to strengthen its presence in the region. No American aircraft carrier is currently deployed in the Persian Gulf, though the Navy was expected to rotate one into the area.
Mr. Mattis defended the decision to put a spotlight on Iran’s behavior, saying that it was important to make Iran recognize that “it is getting the attention of a lot of people.”
But Mr. Mattis said that the United States did not need to deploy additional military resources to signal its concern. “Right now, I do not think that is necessary,” he said.
Mr. Mattis also signaled restraint on another hot spot: the South China Sea. Mr. Mattis said that China’s territorial claim to almost all of its waters “has shredded the trust of nations in the region.” But he emphasized that he saw no need for more military maneuvers in the area.
“What we have to do is exhaust all diplomatic efforts to try to resolve this properly,” he said.
In a meeting on Saturday morning with Japan’s defense minister, Tomomi Inada, Mr. Mattis reiterated the United States’ commitment to defend Japan in any confrontation with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu.
For the Japanese government, that reassurance was perhaps the most important message of Mr. Mattis’s visit, aside from his confirmation of the United States’ broader commitment to the security of its allies in Asia. During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump suggested he might pull back from those commitments unless countries like Japan contributed more to the cost of their defense.
On Friday, after Mr. Mattis wound up a two-day visit to South Korea — where he sought to reassure officials that the U.S. commitment to that country’s defense against North Korea had not changed — the defense secretary told Prime Minister 
 of Japan that the United States would stand by the countries’ mutual defense treaty.
“I want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly, 100 percent, shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people,” Mr. Mattis said at the start of a meeting with Mr. Abe.
During his meeting Saturday with Ms. Inada, Mr. Mattis did not bring up the matter of Japan’s financial commitment to its military defense, according to briefings from both countries.
But in response to a question from a reporter at the Ministry of Defense on Saturday, Mr. Mattis described Japan as “a model of cost sharing and burden sharing” and praised the Abe administration for spending more on the military. Under Mr. Abe, Japan has 
.
Still, the foreign policy community in Japan has begun discussing further increases in military spending, which currently stands at about 1 percent of the country’s economy. “It would not be such a bad thing for Japan to become more self-reliant in terms of security,” wrote the authors of a 
 from the Institute for International Policy Studies released in Tokyo this week.
The American security presence in Japan is most visibly represented by its military bases across the country, with the largest number of troops concentrated in Okinawa, a chain of islands south of the Japanese mainland.
In his meeting with Ms. Inada, Mr. Mattis confirmed that the United States would proceed with relocating one of its bases, the Futenma Air Base in the south of Okinawa’s main island, to a much less populated area in Nago, also on the main island.
That announcement is likely to anger residents in Okinawa who want the base moved off the island altogether and have long complained about noise and violence. This week, the governor of Okinawa, Takeshi Onaga, visited several members of Congress in Washington to lobby them to persuade the Trump administration to withdraw the base from Okinawa.
On Saturday, Mr. Onaga blasted Mr. Mattis for sticking to the relocation plan, calling it “regrettable.”
As a result, Mr. Onaga said in remarks to reporters in Washington, objections from Okinawans “could be intensified and eventually turned into a protest against the entire U.S. forces, and it could impact the stability of base operations. This could cause serious problems for the U.S.-Japan alliance.”","No Extra Forces Needed in Gulf Now, Defense Chief Says","FEB. 4, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/asia/jim-mattis-defense-iran-persian-gulf.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,MICHAEL R.

"Older women living in places with high concentrations of fine particulate matter — the kind common in air pollution across 
 — may be at much greater risk of dementia, including dementia related to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study overseen by scientists in Southern California that was published this week.
The study, led by researchers at the University of Southern California, found that older women who lived in areas where the fine particulate matter exceeded limits set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency had an 81 percent greater chance of general cognitive decline and were 92 percent more likely to develop dementia, according to a 
 on the university’s website.
The study says air pollution could be responsible for up to 21 percent of dementia cases, if the findings translate to the general population, the report said.
The 
 was published Tuesday in Translational Psychiatry, a Nature journal.
The fine particulate matter is PM 2.5, which is 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter. It embeds deep in the lungs and penetrates into the bloodstream. It is the most damaging element of 
, which has some of the world’s most polluted cities. Most of China’s PM 2.5 comes from coal-fired plants, but a significant portion is generated by vehicles.
The study is especially relevant to China in other ways. China has one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing populations of older adults. Ten percent of its 1.4 billion people are 65 years old or older, according to 
.
The report on the University of Southern California website said PM 2.5 enters the body through the nose and can then embed in the brain.
“Cells in the brain treat these particles as invaders and react with inflammatory responses, which over the course of time, appear to exacerbate and promote Alzheimer’s disease,” said Prof. Caleb Finch, one of the authors of the study, according to the report. Professor Finch works at the U.S.C. Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.
“Although the link between air pollution and Alzheimer’s disease is a new scientific frontier, we now have evidence that air pollution, like tobacco, is dangerous to the aging brain,” he added.
Women with the genetic variant APOE4, which increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, were more likely to be affected by high levels of air pollution.
A growing number of studies look at the long-term health effects of air pollution. Research done in the 1990s in Los Angeles and published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that children can suffer permanent lung damage from prolonged exposure to high levels of air pollution.
Columbia University researchers found that prenatal exposure to air pollution could result in children with greater anxiety, depression and attention-span disorders.

"BEIJING — Over a cup of Hong Kong-style “nai cha” — strong black tea thickened with evaporated or condensed milk — a young Chinese woman confided in me why she chose to study psychology at college.
“I want to understand myself. And I want to understand other people,” said the 23-year-old civil society worker, as we whiled away a late afternoon in a 
, or tea canteen, a southern-China-style restaurant, in Beijing.
She asked me to shield her identity, since these days the Chinese state is quick to accuse anyone working in civil society of representing “hostile foreign forces,” so I am identifying her by her surname only: Dong.
Not everyone is as socially engaged or aware as Ms. Dong, of course.
Yet in China today, despite the growing paranoia about foreign things, psychology is “hong,” meaning red, or trendy.
In the 13 years I have 
 from here, “heart science study” and “heart science analysis,” as psychology and psychoanalysis are known in Chinese, have gained enormously in popularity, for perhaps the first time in the country’s history.
Thousands of people offer counseling services in person or online, via couch sessions or magazine columns.
Rattled by suicides among students, each university has a counseling center.
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has a multilevel accreditation system for those who want to shrink China, though some set up illegally, too.
Sure, part of psychology’s popularity is the impact of pop culture from overseas, with American and European movies and TV shows making self-examination, and the language of psychology, seem sophisticated and desirable.
And yes, the ordinary dynamics of life and relationships anywhere in the world may be enough to give anyone problems that require counseling. In that way China is like everywhere.
But specific to this part of the world is a particular combination of Confucianism and Communism that has made social and political repression very extreme at times.
China is ripe for the couch.
There’s the people’s dictatorship that began in 1949 with the Communist revolution, eventually causing the deaths of tens of millions in political campaigns and in starvation. That 
 still cannot be freely acknowledged because the party that caused it continues in power and rules with an iron fist.
Then there is the regret, even torment, over that most intimate of issues: reproduction. Millions of women were forced to abort “out-of-plan” babies to not transgress the one-child policy that ran from 1979 to 2016.
Just this week I spoke to a woman, age 59, who still thinks with longing about the second baby she accidentally conceived 24 years ago, then had to abort, since she already had one child.
The list is long, and there are obstacles to figuring this all out, of course.
Confucianism decrees that a person’s identity is largely determined by her position in the family and society. Rituals of behavior, or “li,” may severely limit what a person can say or do — or even feel — consciously or unconsciously.
A Chinese friend who trained as a Freudian analyst recently expressed her frustration at how hard people find it to open up. Psychically pummeled by families and schools that mold children aggressively from birth, many people have no idea who they are or what they want, she said, though they know when things feel wrong.
I asked my friend for examples of some of the deep issues she sees among her clients these days.
Curiously perhaps for a society that puts so much emphasis on the importance of family, she singled out two problems that seem to spring from familial indifference: the emotionally poor state of many marriages, and 
 of children from their primary caregivers — with many children farmed out to boarding schools or relatives to free up the parents for work. She has run group workshops on both.
There’s also the vexing question of fathers. In the Confucian scheme, which authoritarian Communism closely mirrors, the emperor, or leader, is to the people what the father is to his wife and children: in charge.
“My father says, ‘I’m your father so everything I say is right,’ ” said Ms. Dong, adding (unsurprisingly perhaps), “I’m not close to my father.”

"WASHINGTON — President Trump relishes referring to his new defense secretary, 
, as “Mad Dog.” Mr. Mattis has never liked the nickname, which he argues is a news media invention. But to the commander in chief, it signifies a man who knows how to take the fight to the enemy and win.
During his recent alliance-mending mission in Asia, however, Mr. Mattis was more loyal friend than attack dog, hailed as a welcome voice of sober restraint.
“He appeared calm and considerate to allies despite his nickname,” said Kookmin Ilbo, a South Korean daily newspaper. “Thoughtful and diligent” was the verdict of the Mainichi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper. Even the daily Tokyo Sports weighed in, describing Mr. Mattis as the “only sensible person in the Trump administration.”
The mission, the first overseas trip by a top member of the Trump administration’s national security team, was intended to shore up relations with two essential allies, South Korea and Japan. It required a tricky balance: standing firm against North Korea’s saber rattling and China’s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea — stances that come naturally to a defense secretary — while also reassuring allies made nervous by Mr. Trump’s campaign talk about pulling back from American security commitments in Asia.
The task was all the more challenging given the administration’s mixed signals on foreign policy and Mr. Mattis’s testimony to Congress that he was reluctant to repeat the Obama administration’s language about “rebalancing” or pivoting to Asia, because it implied that the United States was turning away from its defense obligations elsewhere.
South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North Korea, cherishes its strong alliance with the United States. But in a nation still scarred by the Korean War, many are concerned that a hawkish American administration might escalate tensions with the North. They fear that could disrupt their export-driven economy and even lead to an armed conflict with the North under its unpredictable young leader, Kim Jong-un.
During his two-day visit to Seoul, which was his first stop, Mr. Mattis 
 an antimissile system known as Thaad, short for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which would be used to intercept North Korea’s medium-range missiles. In a stark warning to Pyongyang, he said that any use of 
 by North Korea would be met with an “overwhelming” response.
But Mr. Mattis also sought to remind South Koreans of the United States’ past sacrifices for their country and its commitment to their defense.
During a meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Han Min-koo, Mr. Mattis recalled how he had come to South Korea for training in the 1970s when he was a young Marine lieutenant based in Okinawa, Japan. He fondly remembered a Sergeant Chung, a South Korean marine who shared some kimchi with him. He also noted that he had commanded the First Marine Division, which had fought in 1950 in the Chosin Reservoir battle of the Korean War.
Such comments clearly resonated with Mr. Han and top Defense Ministry officials, all of whom are retired or serving military officers and who have had close interactions with American troops. Mr. Mattis is a retired four-star general.
“‘Mad Dog’ Mattis in South Korea was unexpectedly soft,” read a headline in OhMyNews, a widely read online newspaper. It observed that Mr. Mattis, despite his nickname, was considered the most prudent among Trump administration officials when it came to military action because he had seen what war was like.
In Japan, Mr. Mattis sought to carry out a similar balancing act. During the campaign, Mr. Trump threatened to walk away from the mutual defense pact unless the Japanese did more to reimburse the United States more for defending their territory.
But speaking at a joint news conference with his Japanese counterpart on Saturday, Mr. Mattis said that the United States 
, reiterating that the American defense commitment extended to disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. Mr. Mattis also described Japan as “a model of cost sharing” and praised the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for increasing spending on the military.
Strikingly, Mr. Mattis expressed caution about using military force. In contrast, Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump’s new secretary of state, suggested during his confirmation hearing that the United States should be prepared to block China’s access to the islands that it has claimed in the South China Sea and built up with airfields, ports and weapons.
“We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands is also not going to be allowed,” Mr. Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month.
Mr. Mattis has long argued that diplomacy should be backed up by military might, but that force should not be the first recourse. In the case of the South China Sea, he said, it is the diplomats who should be carrying the ball.
“There is no need right now at this time for military maneuvers or something like that,” said Mr. Mattis, who described the dispute as “something that’s best solved by the diplomats.”
With the Trump administration in flux, and the potential for surprises from North Korea and China, it seems likely that there will be fresh challenges. But for now, Mr. Mattis appears to have succeeded in his reassurance mission in Seoul and Tokyo.
“Words matter enormously over there,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a military expert at the Brookings Institution. “Not only did Mattis say all the right things on issues ranging from Thaad to the Senkaku/Diaoyu to the strength of alliances to the need for a firm but steady and nondramatic U.S. approach to the South China Sea, he also went with a listening ear and little bravado. Things are definitely better, at least for the moment.”",Jim Mattis Seeks to Soothe Tensions in Japan and South Korea,"FEB. 5, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/jim-mattis-south-korea-japan.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,MICHAEL R.

Why is it so important to understand the world and the United States’ role in it today?
To begin with, the American economy is inextricably linked to the global economy. It’s estimated that 
 of jobs here are now tied to international trade. Moreover, many of the world’s major challenges — climate change, instability in financial markets, food and water insecurity, infectious diseases, migration, war and terrorism — are complex, interdependent and borderless. And with 40 million foreign-born residents, the United States is itself a global society with deep emotional ties to many nations and cultures. To survive and thrive, Americans have to learn how to manage greater complexity and collaborate across lines of difference.
During the Obama administration, the federal
 recognized this imperative. Since 2012, its strategy has emphasized “
” as a core educational priority. In 2018, the Program for International Student Assessment, an international testing system that sets benchmarks for student performance in which the 
 participates, will add 
 as a new domain.
Nevertheless, many American schools have remained 
 to deliver education in “global competence” (
 by American education leaders as “the capacity and disposition to understand and act on issues of global significance.”) The focus on traditional achievement and test scores has narrowed the delivery of instruction at a time when students need to learn to think more broadly. In the wake of “Brexit” and the election of 
 (both far more popular among older voters than among the young) — and amid the 
 — schools need to help students navigate the forces shaping the world they will inherit.
“What are the 
 that must be cultivated if we’re going to live in a peaceful world?” asked Dana Mortenson, one of the -founders of 
, an organization that has worked with thousands of teachers to integrate global competence into their lessons.
What’s needed is not just scoring well on standardized tests. “It’s an openness to new opportunities and ideas,” she added. “It’s a desire to engage. It’s self-awareness about culture and respect for different perspectives. It’s comfort with ambiguity. It’s the skill to investigate the world through questions. Empathy and humility are big pieces of all of it.”
Teaching these higher-level skills and attitudes might seem a tall order for schools that struggle with the basics. But World Savvy has seen 
 among its partner schools, a majority of them in high-poverty areas. By raising the bar, teachers say, it becomes easier to engage students.
That’s been the experience of Carla Kelly, a special-education teacher at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx who completed a 
, a 15-month graduate-level program developed by World Savvy, the Asia Society and Teachers College at Columbia University.
“I saw that I needed to teach so that my students could contribute anywhere in the world,” Kelly said.
Kelly teaches a variety of subjects — including science, health, Spanish and life skills — in a school that has students and faculty members from 46 countries. She tries to integrate global competence 
 throughout her teaching.
In a unit on nutrition, for instance, students explore foods from around the world, graphing diets against life spans. “We compared diets high in starchy vegetables with places where they eat dark green or sea vegetables,” she said. The connections the students drew were powerful: They learned that people in China live longer than black people in America. They discovered that wherever the American diet was introduced, life spans declined.
In a unit on death, Kelly added an exploration of 11 funeral rites. Students learned that in Ghana, caskets are woven in the shape of objects beloved by the deceased; in South Korea, a person’s remains may be pressed into jewelry; and in Tibet, the mountaintop “sky burial” in the open allows a dead person’s soul to exit the body and be reincarnated. “I asked them to choose five rituals that would be a good fit with their values and cultures,” Kelly said. “I wanted them to make connections, to see how other cultures see life and death.”
“Every class that I’ve revised to include international representation,” she added. “I found that the students made more connections because they had a cultural anchor. And when I assessed what they retained I got content-specific vocabulary because it stuck, especially where they could see aspects of themselves and of people they knew. And the questions I got were better. I stopped getting ‘what’ questions and started getting ‘why’ questions, and ‘what if’ questions.”
At Mill Valley Middle School in California, two teachers, Rod Septka and Maggie Front, working with more affluent students, have seen this approach evoke a similar response. When the recent drought in California was daily news, they looked at how people in the state were conserving water. Then they examined how people cope with water-related problems in Bangladesh, Israel, Sudan, Bolivia, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Peru and Syria. The students did extensive research and data gathering. One student was astonished that so many people around the world couldn’t just go into their kitchen and get water from a tap. Then the water crisis in Flint, Mich., became news, and they looked at water access in terms of wealth and race. That led a student who had been previously disengaged in school to discover her activist voice, said Front. And studying water rights brought her to a related concern: women’s rights.
“A lot of this helps the kids to understand what actions they can take toward solving world issues,” said Front. “It’s not the mission to create activism, but that tends to come out of it.”
In a culminating experience, the students, working in twos, carried five-gallon buckets of water for half a mile. They experimented with ways to do it efficiently, while minimizing spillage, and collected data about time, distance and volume to calculate how long it would take them to provide water for their family. “It was a lot harder than they thought,” said Septka. “It gave them a newfound appreciation for people who have to do things differently than we do.”
Each of these teachers described learning alongside the students, making mistakes, and improving their own global competence in the process.
For now, teacher education that is focused on this area remains at a nascent stage, says William Gaudelli, an associate professor at Teachers College at Columbia University who is a founder of the college’s Global Competence Certificate program and the author of a book titled “
.”
“By and large, our curriculum in the United States is a European great civilization approach — Plato to NATO — with some add-ons for cultural diversity,” he said. “But the condition we live in is fundamentally global. There’s literally nothing that’s not connected far beyond our borders. When people 100 years look back on our generation, they’re going to wonder: How did they know so much about what was going on and do so little to educate about it?”
For Mortenson, a core hurdle is moving beyond the “aversion to complexity in our education system.”
“The system was set up that way because the idea was to standardize knowledge,” she said. “That was appropriate when someone was being trained for a job they might hold for 40 or 50 years. But the world has changed in such profound ways that developing an understanding of complexity is paramount. Whatever the policy, the idea that things are simple, or black and white, and we can put a blanket on them and feel that it’s going to have the desired impact — that idea can become very dangerous.”

"BEIJING — A politely worded but testy debate has flared over a 
 conference on human organ trafficking, with a group of ethicists warning that 
 will use the participation of its most senior transplant official to 
 that it has overhauled its organ procurement system.
In a letter to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Rome, where the two-day 
 began on Tuesday, 11 ethicists wrote: “Our concern is with the harvesting and trafficking of organs from executed prisoners in China.”
China has admitted that it extracted organs from death row prisoners for decades, in what critics have called a serious violation of the rights of inmates who cannot give genuine consent. Since Jan. 1, 2015, Chinese officials have said they no longer use prisoners’ organs, though 
.
“We urge the summit to consider the plight of incarcerated prisoners in China who are treated as expendable human organ banks,” wrote the 11 signatories, who included 
 of Macquarie University in Australia; Arthur Caplan of the New York University Langone Medical Center; 
, both Canadian human rights lawyers; and Enver Tohti, a former surgeon from the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.
The Chinese official attending the meeting, 
, a liver transplant specialist, is co-chairman of the 
 of China, which is charged with remaking the country’s organ donation system to ensure transparency in sourcing and distributing organs in line with international standards.
Reached in Rome, Dr. Huang did not comment immediately, writing in a WeChat message that he was at the meeting and would reply soon.
An article co-written by another member of the national committee, Dr. Zheng Shusen, also a liver transplant specialist, was recently withdrawn after publication by the journal 
 over concerns it relied on data from executed prisoners, Science magazine 
 on Monday.
In their letter, the ethicists also argued that there was no evidence that China had ended the practice of taking organs from executed prisoners, which they said included prisoners of conscience.
“On the contrary, there is evidence that it continues,” they wrote. “Officials from China should not be given the prestigious platform of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences to spread misinformation about reform in China.”
In a response to the letter, addressed to Dr. Rogers, who is also chairwoman of the advisory committee of the International Coalition to End Organ Pillaging in China, Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Science, warned against promoting political agendas.
“The organizer intends for the summit to be an academic exercise and not a reprise of contentious political assertions,” Bishop Sorondo wrote.
In an interview, Dr. Rogers said she disagreed with the bishop’s response. “I thought that was outrageous, really, to try and hedge off any discussion by saying it’s political,” she said. “The weight of evidence is such that it’s up to the Chinese to prove that they’re not doing this, and not the other way round.”
Last year, 4,080 Chinese 
, according to an article published on Monday in the Chinese journal 
 and republished in People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s main newspaper. That number is a small fraction of the total needed. Health officials estimate that each year about 300,000 people in China need a transplant.
To help change the system, officials have issued public appeals and deployed organ donation coordinators at hospitals. But many Chinese are unwilling, fearing that it is unfilial to one’s ancestors be buried with organs missing.
The meeting in Rome comes amid warming ties between China and the Vatican. Pope Francis is eager to visit China, home to millions of Catholics who are members of either the state-sponsored church or the underground church that is loyal to Rome. Some consider themselves members of both.
The Chinese state does not recognize the jurisdiction of Rome over Chinese Catholics, though Catholicism is one of China’s five official religions along with Buddhism, Islam, Protestantism and Taoism. Organizers of the Vatican meeting said they hoped it would help generate remedies to the problem of organ trafficking and transplant tourism, which they called a “form of human slavery” afflicting many parts of the world.
“We hope this summit will create a top-down and bottom-up movement in society, to raise awareness of the extension and seriousness of this modern challenge and lay the groundwork for moral and appropriate solutions based on human dignity, freedom, justice and peace,” the academy’s website said.
In a Twitter post last year, Pope Francis made clear his objections to organ trafficking:
The Vatican knows about the problem surrounding organ sourcing in China and wants to help change it, said 
, a specialist in Catholic affairs at Renmin University of China who interviewed the pope last year.
“They are well aware of the situation,” Mr. Sisci said in an email. “But the Vatican can only do this: encourage better behavior. It can’t start a trade war or send in the Swiss Guards as paratroopers,” he added, referring to the small force responsible for the pope’s safety.
Condemning the perpetrators “may be good revenge, but that’s the job of the Nuremberg trials, or of God,” Mr. Sisci said. “The church has a different job: to try to improve the world, in this case China. To understand what it is, not what we would like it to be.”",Debate Flares Over China’s Inclusion at Vatican Organ Trafficking Meeting,"FEB. 7, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/world/asia/china-vatican-organ-transplants.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW
"The United States and 
 have been inextricably linked since the birth of America. The first fortunes made in the United States came thanks to the tea trade with China. The profits made in Canton and reinvested in America transformed the young republic into the 19th century’s factory of the world. For its part, 19th-century China turned to the United States as the first country to educate its young in a desperate effort to counter the West. In the present day, the United States, with its open wallets, open universities and open society, has been by far the most important foreign enabler of China’s rise.
Throughout the course of this shared history, Americans have generally held that a strong China was in their interests. But now that China is strong, many Americans are not so sure. For the last decade and a half, neither side has figured out how much of the other it wants and how much of the other it hates.
No matter who became United States president in 2017, a reckoning was due. China’s rise has been too rapid. Along the way, Beijing has gamed the international system created by the United States to increase its growth at the expense of others, engaged in widespread industrial espionage as a shortcut to innovation, repressed free speech at home and bolstered governments abroad such as North Korea that threaten their neighbors and the United States.
Regardless of political party, the majority of those in Washington who make China policy have united around the view that Beijing has, in the words of one adviser to President Trump, “played the United States for a sucker for far too long.”
But the complexity and depth of the relationship makes reconfiguring it fraught with risks. China is now a major world power, and its economy is tightly interwoven with America’s. More than 300,000 Chinese students attend American universities. Chinese firms have invested upward of $100 billion in the United States. Apple sells more iPhones in China than in the United States, and 150,000 Boeing employees rely on its China sales for their jobs.
In the last few weeks, both President 
 and Mr. Trump have set out to show the world how different they are. On Jan. 17 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Xi defended globalization and equated 
 with “locking oneself in a dark room.” Mr. Trump’s retort came on Jan. 20 with a fiery inauguration speech promising that in all ways he would put America first. As one of his first acts as president, Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact grouping 12 nations along the Pacific Rim, excluding China. Mr. Xi, seeking to capitalize on the folly of Mr. Trump’s move, then invited those Asian neighbors abandoned by America to join a Chinese-led regional economic partnership.
There is a rich irony in both approaches. At Davos, Mr. Xi portrayed himself as the un-Trump, the last defender of globalization. It was a cynical move: China’s embrace of globalization can roughly be defined as having foreigners buy as much Chinese stuff as possible and demanding that foreign firms share their technological secrets with Chinese partners so that a Chinese competitor can learn to make a product at a lower price.
For his part, Mr. Trump seems to be channeling more Mao Zedong than Andrew Jackson. Mao used the passions whipped up by China’s fight with America during the Korean War as a way to bring his Communist revolution to the point of no return, to make China the un-America. A Chinese Communist Party directive in 1951 ordered that the admiration for the United States that coursed through Chinese society must be redirected into “hate the U.S. imperialists,” with the goal of “encouraging national self-confidence and self-respect” — forever joining the yin of hating America with the yang of loving China.
The Chinese Maoist thinker Zhang Hongliang said in a recent blog post that Mr. Trump’s commitment to put America first reminds him of Mao’s famed 1949 speech that the “Chinese people have stood up.” In Mr. Trump’s vow to battle Washington’s elite, Mr. Zhang sees Mao’s promise to obliterate capitalist overlords and establish a “people’s government.” And in Mr. Trump’s maddening unpredictability there are echoes of one of Mao’s famous quotes: “There is chaos under heaven, the situation is excellent.”
Mr. Trump has returned to a more negative view of the Middle Kingdom that has shadowed America’s policy of benevolent solicitude since the two countries began interacting in 1784.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump’s accusations that China was “raping” the United States over trade recalled the railings of Denis Kearney, the firebrand founder of the Workingmen’s Party in 1880s California who at the end of each rally would lead the crowd in a chant, “The Chinese must go!” Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Kearney masterfully merged a hatred of the robber barons — the elites of the day — with a fear of China.
The Workingmen’s Party used its heft to lobby Washington to bar Chinese people from America’s shores. This coalesced in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which, in its prohibition of Chinese laborers’ traveling to America, was the first time Americans targeted a specific immigrant group for exclusion from the United States. Sound familiar?
Mr. Trump’s tactics mark an end to the strategy pursued for decades by American leaders who held that an open America would create a more open China. In this, he is ignoring the main lesson of the two countries’ shared history: Isolating China doesn’t work.
It took 61 years for the United States to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, and it did an enormous amount of hurt. It persuaded the Chinese to favor Communism over capitalism and kept the Chinese community in America isolated, small and scared.
Ignoring China in the 1950s did a similar disservice. Indeed, Mao was clearly petrified of closer ties with America, telling the Soviet ambassador in January 1955 that a lack of relations with the United States “gives us the chance to more freely educate our people in the anti-American spirit.”
Starting a trade war with China or gearing up for a military conflict in the South China Sea will do very much the same. It will push China into a defensive crouch, validate its paranoia and allow it to nurture its anti-American fears. It will also provide Mr. Xi with the opportunity to profit from Mr. Trump’s missteps, to appear statesmanlike when Mr. Trump appears bellicose, to bully Taiwan and to make China’s repressive system of government seem more attractive.
Far better for Mr. Trump to use his maddening unpredictability and all the leverage available to an American president to dare China to open its society further and to become a responsible world leader.

"HONG KONG — President Trump’s public criticism of a federal judge who 
 was condemned across the political spectrum as an assault on judicial independence. Now the president is being taken to task from an unexpected place: 
.
Judge He Fan of the 
 of China published a 
 about Mr. Trump’s reaction to Judge James L. Robart’s recent ruling blocking key parts of his executive order that barred visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Judge He said that Mr. Trump had breached the principle of an independent judiciary, and that people who attacked judges were “public enemies of the law.”
“Even if you control the armed forces and have nuclear weapons,” Judge He wrote in the post, published on Sunday, “your dignity has been swept away and you are no different than a villain.”
The notion of a Chinese jurist remarking on the danger he believes Mr. Trump poses to the separation of powers may seem, at first blush, to smack of hypocrisy. In China, courts are firmly under the command of the Communist Party. Last month, the chief justice 
 the notion of judicial independence, warning judges not to fall into the “trap” of “Western” ideology.
But the harsh public face presented last month by the chief justice, Zhou Qiang, obscures what is happening on his watch. Judges like Mr. He admire the American legal system and study it to improve China’s rules, such as how to handle plea bargains or what to do with evidence obtained illegally, said Susan Finder, an American scholar who publishes the 
, a blog that focuses on China’s top court.
Ms. Finder said that Judge He was an avowed “Scotus junkie” who translates books about the Supreme Court of the United States and works on the court’s judicial reform committee. Works that have been translated by Judge He include “
,” by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, and “
,” by Linda Greenhouse, about former Justice Harry A. Blackmun.
“The Supreme People’s Court looks more at the U.S. than you would ever think,” said Ms. Finder, who is a scholar at the 
 at Peking University’s campus in the southern city of Shenzhen. “They are looking to try to improve the prestige of the Chinese judiciary.”
Unlike the United States Supreme Court, which has nine justices, China’s highest court has hundreds of judges, including those, like Judge He, whose main focus is outside the courtroom.
In his post, which includes an image of a 
 in which Mr. Trump referred to the “so-called judge” who blocked his immigration order, Judge He also takes aim at violence against judicial officials in China, bringing up a case of the killing of a retired jurist in the southern region of Guangxi.
In doing so, Judge He, who could not be reached for comment, may be using Mr. Trump’s assault on the independence of America’s judiciary to safely and indirectly level some criticism against China’s own system.
“That could be part of the message,” said Ms. Finder, who has known Judge He for about three years and has

"The United States’ relationship with 
 was strained during the Obama administration, with sharp differences over economic and trade issues, cyberattacks and Beijing’s assertive maneuvers in the South China Sea.
But since taking office last month, President Trump has signaled that matters could get even more contentious, as his administration has vowed to project more military might in Asia and to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods. China could respond with its own punitive measures.
A 
 by a bipartisan task force of prominent China specialists is warning of dire consequences, including the possibility of a trade war or an armed skirmish, unless the United States can find a more effective way to engage China.
The 
 to be issued Tuesday by the 
 and the 
 at the 
, urged the Trump administration to take a tougher line on China, while reaffirming principles that have guided relations between the two nations since the 1970s.
At times, the report, “U.S. Policy Toward China: Recommendations for a New Administration,” seemed at odds with the new president. It argued that the White House should support a trade agreement similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump 
, to strengthen economic ties in Asia.
And it cautioned the administration not tamper with Washington’s commitment to a One China policy — a clear reference to 
 that the United States could ignore what had become a central tenet of the relationship after President Richard M. Nixon’s groundbreaking trip to China in 1972.
The report urged swift action to reassure the United States’ allies in Asia about its security commitments there. It also recommended that the administration initiate talks, as soon as possible, with China’s leaders and develop constructive policies on what the task force identified as the six most critical areas of engagement, including efforts to halt 
.
“We’re really at a critical inflection point,” said 
, a scholar at the 
 and a chairman of the task force. “We are worried about the increasingly antagonistic relationship” and “think the U.S. needs to up its game in terms of the effort its puts into high-level negotiations.”
Mr. Trump has given no clear indication of how he will deal with China, but his administration has hinted at a more confrontational approach. The commerce secretary, 
 Jr., has complained about Chinese tariffs, and Mr. Trump named 
, a strident critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy.
The defense secretary, 
, has said the United States would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Japan and its Asian allies, which angered China. He has also 
, however, saying on Saturday in Tokyo that military maneuvers in the South China Sea were unnecessary. Diplomacy, he said, should resolve the differences.
The task force rebuked Mr. Trump’s questioning of the One China policy, by which the United States recognizes the government in Beijing, rather than that of Taiwan, as representing China.
The report said that “it would be exceedingly dangerous to unilaterally abandon our longstanding One China policy — an understanding that has served as the basis for the U.S. relationship with China, helped protect Taiwan’s security, prosperity and democracy, and preserved peace and stability in Asia for almost four decades.”
“Across-the-board tariffs or challenging the One China policy is not the way to go,” said 
, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and a chairwoman of the task force. “We shouldn’t undervalue what we’ve achieved over the years — a more or less peaceful Asia, a big market for exports and a key partner on global problems, like 
. If it was to become unhinged, it’s not just chaos in Asia but destabilizing for the global economy.”
United States-China relations have been charged for decades, particularly after the military suppression of 
 in Beijing. But the task force said that American policies, regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican was president, had helped integrate China into the global economy and encouraged it to adhere to a rules-based international system.
But relations worsened after the 2008 financial crisis, which China withstood well with a huge stimulus package, it said. Beijing’s leaders grew more hostile toward economic and military supremacy by the United States. In 2013, with 
 as president, these tendencies hardened.
Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that as China’s economy grew, so did its abilities and determination, and old suspicions that the United States wanted to contain it resurfaced.
“China’s goal is clear: It wants to be a regional power,” said Mr. Li, who was not on the task force. “Xi Jinping wants to revitalize China’s glorious past. And, with the world’s second-largest economy, it wants to build a stronger military.”
The task force report said the Chinese government also tightened restrictions on American internet companies, nongovernmental organizations and media outlets.
As relations between Washington and Beijing started deteriorating, the task force was formed two years ago to make recommendations for the next president. Its members included Charlene Barshefsky, a former United States trade representative; Winston Lord, a former United States ambassador to China; Kurt M. Campbell, a former State Department officer; and Evan S. Medeiros, a special assistant to President Barack Obama on Asia.
As they began to meet, consensus emerged that the United States needed to strengthen its resolve and show greater firmness in dealing with China.
The task force urged the administration to keep a strong military presence in Asia. It also said new policy and diplomatic tools, including sanctions, litigation over trade disputes and the use of reciprocal measures, were needed. For example, if China restricted investment or trade, the United States might need to do the same.
The administration should make clear its resolve to combat climate change, avoid 
, reaffirm the One China policy, bolster its military commitments in Asia and, effectively, stay the course, the task force said.
The task force warned that if the new administration alters the basic course that has long guided United States relations with China, it could “destabilize not only the bilateral relationship, but also the region as a whole.”",Task Force Urges Better U.S. Engagement With China,"FEB. 6, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/world/asia/china-us-relations.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,DAVID BARBOZA
"DJIBOUTI — The 10:24 a.m. train out of 
’s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month. Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers, the crush of African leaders, European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine, air-conditioned carriages making their inaugural run.
“It is indeed a historic moment, a pride for our nations and peoples,” said Hailemariam Desalegn, the prime minister of 
, shortly before the train — the first electric transnational railway in Africa — headed toward Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. “This line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries.”
But perhaps the biggest star of the day was 
, which designed the system, supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the 466-mile line. And the $4 billion cost? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing.
Having constructed one of the world’s most extensive and modern rail networks at home, China is taking its prodigious resources and expertise global. Chinese-built subway cars will soon appear in 
 and 
, Beijing is building a $5 billion 
 line 
, and the Chinese government recently christened 
 between London and Beijing. Another ambitious system in the works, the 2,400-mile 
, would link China to Laos, Thailand and Singapore.
But few places are being reshaped by China’s overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century.
Despite years of steady economic growth, sub-Saharan Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit, according to the 
, with only half of its roads paved and nearly 600 million people lacking access to electricity.
Chinese companies, many of them state-owned and grappling with an economic slowdown at home, have stepped unto the breach, earning about $50 billion a year on new ports, highways and airports across the continent, according to the 
 at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
Many of the projects are part of Beijing’s 
, a $1 trillion effort intended to deepen ties between China and its trading partners in the developing world.
Much of that spending has been directed at rail projects that planners hope will transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another, and the rest of the world.
Chinese-built and -financed projects include a two-year-old light-
 in the Ethiopian capital; 
 between the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the port city of Mombasa that will open later this year; and an 
 that includes an urban transit system for Lagos.
“For the longest time, railroads across Africa were limping along and in decline, but with the Chinese, that’s definitely changing,” said Andrew Grantham, the news editor at 
, a trade publication.
China’s enthusiasm for constructing railroads, schools and stadiums in Africa stands in marked contrast to the role of the United States, which has largely shied away from financing infrastructure on the continent. One of the few exceptions, 
, a $9.7 billion initiative announced by President Barack Obama in 2013, has fallen far short of its goal of providing electricity to 20 million households within five years.
When it comes to trade, China 
 in 2009 to become Africa’s biggest trading partner.
It remains unclear how that calculus might change under the Trump administration. President Trump has questioned the benefits of free trade agreements, and 
 from his transition team that was sent to the State Department last month expressed skepticism for foreign aid and development efforts in Africa.
That worries some African officials and longtime experts, who fear the loss of American influence and largess — and the good will that is often produced by desperately needed infrastructure projects.
Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the United States was also missing opportunities to cultivate loyal customers.
“If you’re looking for new markets, Africa is the place to be,” he said. “But right now, the U.S. is not leveraging Africa’s huge potential. By contrast, the Chinese are there, and they are willing to take risks.”
China is placing more than $14 billion worth of bets here in Djibouti, a geopolitically strategic speck of a country beset by soaring poverty and unemployment. The projects include three ports, two airports and a pipeline that will bring water from Ethiopia, its landlocked neighbor and a regional economic power that depends on Djibouti’s ports for 90 percent of its foreign trade.
Also on the drawing board are a series of Chinese-built, coal-fired power plants that would ease summertime electricity failures and help fuel a new tax-free manufacturing zone that officials hope will turn Djibouti into a Hong Kong-style entrepôt and international shipping hub.
Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, said he hoped the new railway linking his country to the Ethiopian capital would be just the first leg of a long-dreamed trans-Africa route, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic.
“The train is already a game-changer,” he said, noting that it will cut to 12 hours what until now had been a grueling three- or four-day trip by truck.
Mr. Hadi praised the Chinese for going all in after Western banks declined to help finance the nation’s glaring infrastructure needs.
“We approached the U.S., and they didn’t have the vision,” he said. “They are not thinking ahead 30 years. They only have a vision of Africa from the past, as a continent of war and famine. The Chinese have vision.”
Not everyone is comfortable with China’s vision. Some worry about the leverage China wields and what happens when countries fall behind on loan payments.
For Djibouti, the debt is especially daunting, amounting to 60 percent of its gross domestic product. But Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh, the country’s finance minister, dismissed such concerns, saying Djibouti’s heady 6.7 percent growth rate would allow it to meet its loan payments.
“If we don’t take this risk now and develop our infrastructure, we will remain stuck in poverty,” he said. “Come back in a few years, and you will find that Djibouti has become the logistics hub of the continent.”
Others worry about the Djiboutian government’s lack of transparency, its authoritarian impulses and a vexing legacy of official corruption. Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a leader of Djibouti’s embattled opposition and a former presidential candidate, said the lack of information about the terms of China’s loans raised questions about potential malfeasance.
“We’re talking about billions of dollars and complete opacity,” he said. “Have there been kickbacks to government officials? There is no way to know.”
Others wonder what will happen to the system after the Chinese leave. European imperialists in Africa built a skein of lines, most of which fell into disrepair in the decades after their colonies achieved independence.
Jamie Monson, the author of “Africa’s Freedom Railway,” a book documenting the legacy of the Chinese-built train linking Tanzania and Zambia, said long-term maintenance could be more challenging than initial construction. Built during the Cold War and hailed as a symbol of Chinese-African friendship, the train, the Tazara Railway, has struggled to maintain regular service, prompting talk of a Chinese takeover.
“Without proper maintenance comes problems, which can have a huge impact on a regional economy and local people’s livelihoods,” she said.
For now, however, much of nation is euphoric over the completion of Djibouti’s first modern railway, which follows the path of a creaky 
, completed in 1917, that met its demise several years ago after generations of neglect.
Although workers from China did much of the technical and engineering work, thousands of Djiboutian and Ethiopian laborers were hired to lay tracks and dig tunnels, helping to head off some of the local resentment that has dogged other Chinese projects in Africa. The system will be operated by Chinese conductors for five years and then turned over to local citizens, many of them trained in China.
After a boisterous opening day ceremony in the broiling sun, only the best-connected attendees were allowed to board the train, which filled with applause and song as it glided out of the station.
Daha Ahmed Osman, 34, a tech specialist who works for the Djiboutian government, displayed a wide grin as he watched the arid, harshly beautiful landscape spill across the train’s picture windows.
He predicted that the new train would transform Djibouti and Ethiopia, and eventually all of Africa. “For this, we have the Chinese to thank, because they shared with us their money and their technology,” he said. “More than anything we thank them for showing confidence in us.”","Joyous Africans Take to the Rails, With China’s Help","FEB. 7, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/world/africa/africa-china-train.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,ANDREW JACOBS
"YINING, China — When scientists and environmental scholars scan the grim industrial landscape of 
, a certain coal plant near the rugged Kazakhstan border stands out.
On the outside, it looks like any other modern energy plant — shiny metal towers loom over the grassy grounds, and workers in hard hats stroll the campus. But in those towers, a rare and contentious process is underway, spewing an alarming amount of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas accelerating 
.
The plant and others like it undermine China’s aim of being a global leader on efforts to limit climate change.
The plant, in the country’s far west, converts coal to synthetic 
. The process, called coal-to-gas or coal gasification, has been criticized by Chinese and foreign scholars and policy makers. For one thing, it is relatively expensive. It also requires enormous amounts of water, which exacerbates the 
 in northern China. And worst of all, critics say, it emits more carbon dioxide than traditional methods of energy production, even other coal-based ways.
“It is extremely irrational to develop coal-to-gas technology,” Li Junfeng, a climate change and energy adviser to the government, wrote in 2015 in China Energy News, a publication managed by People’s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper. He added that coal-to-gas was “unfit to become a national strategy.”
Despite such denunciations and a continuing policy debate, at least four such plants have begun operating in China in the past four years, pushed by local governments and state-owned enterprises in coal-rich regions. Dozens more have been under consideration.
No other country is considering building coal-to-gas plants on this scale.
The technology’s emerging use reveals the challenges China faces in reducing coal’s central role in the economy, particularly in the north, which has some of the world’s largest coal deposits.
Under the Obama administration, United States officials working on climate change tracked China’s use of this technology and expressed concern to Chinese counterparts, including the environmental protection minister, Chen Jining. That will most likely change under President Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax” and threatened to renounce the Paris agreement, a global accord to limit carbon emissions.
In January, President Xi Jinping said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that all countries should remain committed to the Paris agreement because “this is a responsibility we must shoulder for the sake of our future generations.”
The Chinese government is trying to rein in local officials and companies in northern China that undermine central policy when acting out of economic self-interest. Too often, the actions of local governments contradict attempts by central policy makers to wean Chinese industries off coal and move toward a less carbon-heavy economy.
“With the economy and market conditions, we really don’t think this is a good choice,” said Gan Yiwei, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, based in Beijing, who has researched coal-to-gas plants.
The plant here in the frontier region of Xinjiang is a pioneer effort by coal proponents. It was opened by a local subsidiary of the China Kingho Energy Group, the country’s largest private coal mining company, and is outside the city of Yining, whose population is a mix of ethnic Han, Uighur, Kazakh and other groups.
Ethnic tensions in the area sometimes explode into protests or violence, and police officers in riot gear stand at barricaded posts on many of Yining’s street corners. The tensions are 
 — Xinjiang has vast coal and 
 deposits, and ethnic minorities are aware that state-owned energy companies exploiting local resources are run by ethnic Han and employ mostly Han workers.
In 2013, Kingho opened the coal-to-gas plant as a pilot project closely watched by central-level officials. Xinjiang has the largest coal reserves in China. The same year, a similar pilot project opened in Inner Mongolia, another region brimming with coal.
After the market for coal slumped in 2012, local governments in northern China desperately began looking for new uses for it. Officials turned to two industries in which coal is converted to other material: coal-to-gas and coal-to-chemicals. Officials have expanded both industries across northern China, despite their detrimental environmental impact.
Two Duke University researchers published an essay in 2013 recommending that Chinese officials cancel the coal-to-gas programs. Some central government officials understood that there were risks to adopting these technologies. The National Development and Reform Commission, the government’s economic planning agency, held a forum in January 2014 for experts to discuss the effects of coal-to-gas on climate change. There have been no public reports on the conference.
In July 2014, Greenpeace East Asia 
 that said governments and companies across China had plans to operate 50 coal-to-gas plants. That would produce an estimated 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year — equal to one-eighth of China’s total carbon dioxide emissions at the time — and contribute significantly to climate change, the authors said. Eighty percent of the projects were set to open in northwestern China, the country’s most water-stressed region.
Around the same time, China’s National Energy Administration banned the construction of any coal-to-gas plants that would produce less than two billion cubic meters of gas per year.
So while central government officials take a cautious approach to the industry, they are still allowing it to grow. Last year, a coal-to-gas plant opened in Henan Province, the first in the east. Also in 2016, the Ministry of Environmental Protection approved three new plants. And at least three existing plants are expanding.
Kingho signed an agreement last October to push ahead with a “Phase 2” expansion of the Yining plant.
Kingho declined an interview request and did not agree to take me on a tour. On a Saturday, I walked onto the grounds, after a guard in a black uniform at the main gate asked me to sign a visitors’ logbook. The roads were wide and quiet, and a few workers in uniforms rode around on electric scooters.
The plant is far from China’s largest population centers. Across the northwest, companies would have to build and operate long pipelines to get gas to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Yet local governments and state-owned enterprises justify construction of the plants by saying they will eventually supply gas to eastern China.
The idea of transporting gas from the west aligns with pollution control policies announced in 2013. That year, after a rise in public anger over air pollution, the government said officials in populous parts of eastern China had to limit coal use, which meant those officials would have to look for other energy sources, including gas.
State-owned energy companies label coal-to-gas plants as “clean energy” or “new energy,” despite their high levels of carbon dioxide emissions. In his 2015 article, Mr. Li said that carbon dioxide emissions from coal-to-gas were 270 percent greater than 
 from traditional sources.
“They do not reduce emissions,” said Lin Boqiang, the director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University. “They only shift emissions elsewhere. Actually, they increase emissions.”
Another climate researcher, Jiang Kejun, said that if China adopted coal-to-gas on a larger scale in five to 10 years, then officials would have to find a way to get companies to use carbon capture technology to limit the effect of the emissions.
Since coal-to-gas plants are expensive to operate, market forces may end up dampening their popularity, he said.
“It’s very risky, and there is no clear future,” he said. “So I believe enterprises themselves will be very cautious.”
In early 2015, China Business Journal published a report that said a coal-to-gas plant run by a 
 subsidiary in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, was operating at a daily loss of 1.12 million renminbi, about $160,000.
Antipollution regulations, if properly enforced by officials, could also bring the projects to a halt. The Yili Xintian Coal Chemical Company has been trying to open a new coal-to-gas plant here in Yining, but local environmental protection officials told the company to stop in 2015. They said the plant could pollute the Yili River, an important water source.
In February 2016, the company rewrote the project report, arguing that the plant would be environmentally friendly. Despite objections from local residents during the public comment period, the Ministry of Environmental Protection approved the plant in December.
China has forged recent agreements with Russia and Central Asian nations to buy natural gas. Pipelines running across the Asian heartland transport the gas through Xinjiang to eastern China.
Those pipelines also damage the environment and cultural sites, but some scholars say they have greater concerns over the use of coal-to-gas.
“The development of coal-to-gas technology,” Mr. Li wrote, “will actually bring a relatively large negative influence to the already fragile local ecological environment.”",‘Irrational’ Coal Plants May Hamper China’s Climate Change Efforts,"FEB. 7, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/world/asia/china-coal-gas-plants-climate-change.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina&_r=0,EDWARD WONG
"WASHINGTON — President-elect 
 on Wednesday named a strident China critic, Peter Navarro, to lead a new White House office overseeing American trade and industrial policy, in the latest sign that Mr. Trump is moving to reshape relations between the world’s two largest economies.
Mr. Trump also said the billionaire investor 
 would serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues, another area of economic policy in which the president-elect wants big changes.
The appointments reflect Mr. Trump’s ambition to increase economic growth by hammering at what he regards as critical roadblocks. He has promised to expand American manufacturing by reducing federal regulation and by preventing what he has described as unfair competition from Chinese manufacturers. The choices of Mr. Navarro and Mr. Icahn also reflect Mr. Trump’s manifest preference for advisers who are loyal, and who do not have government experience.
Mr. Navarro, 67, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, who holds a doctorate from Harvard, is the only credentialed economist in Mr. Trump’s inner circle. He is the author of a series of jeremiads, including a 2012 documentary film, “
,” in which an animation of a Chinese knife stabs a map of the United States and causes blood to run freely. Mr. Navarro has said that China is effectively waging an economic war by subsidizing exports to the United States and impeding imports from it. Mr. Trump, influenced by Mr. Navarro’s work, described this on the campaign trail as “the greatest theft in the history of the world.”
Mr. Trump has said he will persuade Beijing to change its policies by applying pressure, including designating China a currency manipulator; enforcing existing trade laws more vigorously; and, if necessary, imposing a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. In a statement, Mr. Trump described Mr. Navarro as “a visionary economist” and said he would “develop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores.”
A wide range of economists have warned that curtailing trade with China would damage the American economy, forcing consumers to pay higher prices for goods and services. Experts on manufacturing also doubt that the government can significantly increase factory employment, noting that mechanization is the major reason fewer people are working in factories.
Mr. Navarro’s appointment reinforces a basic division among Mr. Trump’s economic advisers. The people he has chosen to oversee trade policy, Mr. Navarro and 
, another billionaire investor, both favor increased trade restrictions. But Mr. Trump’s broader circle of advisers is dominated by proponents of free trade, including Mr. Icahn; 
, the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council; 
, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who was tapped for secretary of state; and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, 
. Mr. Trump is also considering the appointment of Larry Kudlow, a strong proponent of trade, to lead his Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr. Trump has also promised to edit the federal rule book, removing what he has described as overly burdensome restrictions. He said last month that the government would eliminate two regulations for each new rule it put on the books. For Mr. Icahn, who will not draw a salary, the new role formalizes his relationship with Mr. Trump, whom he advised on economic issues throughout the campaign. Mr. Icahn, 80, has no experience in government; like a growing number of Mr. Trump’s appointees, he was prized for his success as a businessman.
Mr. Icahn, a brash New York billionaire who vocally supported Mr. Trump during the campaign, made his fortune as a “corporate raider,” buying stakes in corporations and demanding changes to reward shareholders. “Carl was with me from the beginning, and with his being one of the world’s great businessmen, that was something I truly appreciated,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “His help on the strangling regulations that our country is faced with will be invaluable.”
Mr. Icahn will also play a role in the selection of a new chairman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator that serves as the referee for his battles with corporations.
Mr. Icahn, the child of two New York schoolteachers, was not known for political activism before the 2016 campaign, and he has insisted that he wants to help the country, not himself. But Mr. Trump’s choice of a major corporate investor to play a role in rewriting regulations that could affect those companies renewed concerns about conflicts of interest in the next administration.
“The corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated,” Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement about Mr. Icahn’s appointment. “Voters who wanted Trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud.”
Mr. Navarro has built a quiet career as an academic economist, publishing papers on subjects like why businesses give to charity, electricity deregulation and the economics of trash collection.
He also mounted four unsuccessful political campaigns as a Democrat between 1992 and 2001, including candidacies for mayor of San Diego and a House seat in Congress.
He has said that he started paying attention to China in the early 2000s because he noticed that graduates of the business school at California, Irvine, were starting to lose jobs as a result of globalization. In 2011, he wrote a letter to Mr. Trump about his book “Death by China,” which the movie was based on, and the men began to correspond. Over the past year, Mr. Navarro became an increasingly important campaign adviser on economic issues. But he and Mr. Trump had not met in person until September.","Trump Taps Peter Navarro, Vocal Critic of China, for New Trade Post","DEC. 21, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/us/politics/peter-navarro-carl-icahn-trump-china-trade.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
"LONDON — 
 and 
 announced on Monday that they would normalize relations, six years after the decision 
 to the imprisoned democracy advocate 
 opened a rift between the countries.
Neither nation explained the timing of the announcement, but analysts said Norway hoped to revive talks on a trade deal that stalled after the Nobel committee awarded the 2010 prize to Mr. Liu, a literary critic and political essayist.
The news accompanied an unannounced visit to Beijing by the Norwegian foreign minister, Borge Brende, who met with Premier Li Keqiang.
“Through meticulous and numerous conversations, the two sides have, over the last years, reached a level of trust that allows for resumption of a normal relationship,” they said in a 
, which stated that Norway was “fully conscious of the position and concerns of the Chinese side” over the prize.
The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in a statement that “Norway deeply reflected upon the reasons bilateral mutual trust was harmed, and had conscientious, solemn consultations with China about how to improve bilateral relations.”
In the statement, Norway said it “fully respects China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, attaches high importance to China’s core interests and major concerns, will not support actions that undermine them, and will do its best to avoid any future damage to the bilateral relations.”
Rights advocates expressed concern that Norway might be caving on its longtime commitment to democracy and human rights.
“We are worried about some of the wording in the declaration,” John Peder Egenaes, secretary general of Amnesty International in Norway, said in an interview. “If this sentence means the Norwegian government becomes subservient, we will criticize them for it. Time will tell. Human rights have been a foreign policy priority for Norway, and in particular support for champions of human rights. This policy has to apply to China, as much as to any other place.”
Stein Tonnesson, a historian and former director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said the agreement was “of huge importance to Norway” because of the commercial potential. Norway’s salmon industry stands to benefit significantly.
Mr. Tonnesson said he doubted that the agreement would impair Norway’s reputation as an advocate for human rights
 but he added that the timing — weeks after the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States — was significant.
“The deal with Norway might be one pawn in a greater game to secure and renew trade policy with other countries in Europe and elsewhere traditionally close to the U.S.,” he said.
Mr. Liu, 60, was arrested in China in December 2008 and is serving an 
 for “inciting subversion of state power” by organizing a petition urging an end to one-party rule.
The decision by the 
, which is composed of five members appointed by Parliament but is independent of the government, drew outrage from the government in Beijing. China had 
 the secretary of the Nobel committee against giving Mr. Liu the prize, and after the decision, Beijing 
 with Norwegian officials and it later halted the trade talks.
Even so, “the overall impact on trade, even in the seafood sectors, was not very profound, and bilateral trade hit record levels in 2015,” according to 
, a senior research fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.
At the prize ceremony in December 2010, Mr. Liu was 
. It was the first time since 1935 — when the laureate was Carl von Ossietzky, a German pacifist detained by the Nazis — that no relative or representative of the prize’s recipient was present to accept the award or the $1.5 million check that came with it.
In 2013, after 
 Norway’s center-left government, the new conservative government vowed to improve relations with China. Symbolic steps were taken in that direction.

The chilly relations were also seen as a factor in the decision to demote the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the diplomat Thorbjorn Jagland, in March 2015, though he had also drawn criticism when the 2009 Peace Prize was awarded to President Obama.
“No specific concessions have publicly been given on the Norwegian side, but the devil is always in the details,” said Bjornar Sverdrup-Thygeson, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. “The degree to which there is mutual understanding of the definition of this will be a thing to watch in the years ahead, in particular the next time the Dalai Lama plans a visit to Norway.”

"SHANGHAI — Chinese officials cheered on the country’s stock market when it reached heady new highs, offering hope that it could become a new source of money to fix China’s economic problems. Then, last year, 
.
Now another fast-growing part of China’s vast and increasingly complicated financial market is showing signs of distress: its $9 trillion bond market.
Prices for government and corporate bonds have tumbled over the past week, a sell-off that continued on Tuesday. The situation has spooked investors, prompting the government to temporarily restrain some trading and to make emergency loans to struggling financial institutions.
The price drops have resulted in higher borrowing costs at a time when more Chinese companies need the money to cope with 
. Yields reached new highs again on Tuesday.
In part, China is reacting to financial shifts across the globe. With the 
 and many expecting the presidency of Donald J. Trump to lead to heavier government spending, investors worldwide are selling bonds.
But China is struggling with its own balancing act. The Chinese bond slump also stems from Beijing’s efforts to wring 
 from its financial system and to stop potential 
 that may lurk in shadowy, hard-to-track corners of its economy. Should it continue with those efforts, bonds could fall further.
“The adjustment has not yet finished,” said Miao Zuoxing, a partner at the FXM Brothers Fund, a Shanghai-based investment fund that trades stocks, bonds and futures. “It will continue and normalize until money is put where the government can see it.”
At least 40 companies have said they would postpone or cancel bond offerings rather than risk being forced to pay high interest rates to sell the bonds — or being unable to sell them at all. Among them was the Jiangsu Sumec Group Corporation, an industrial trading house that exports items as varied as gardening tools and auto parts; the company said on Thursday that it would not go through with the sale of $130 million in short-term bonds.
“Due to recent, relatively large market fluctuations, our company decided to cancel the issue of the current bond,” Jiangsu Sumec Group said in a statement, “and will reissue it at a chosen time.”
China has particular reason to worry. As the world’s second-largest economy, after the United States, it relies on a rickety financial system that is mired in debt and susceptible to hidden stresses. Higher overseas interest rates could also prompt more Chinese investors to move their money out of the country, either to chase higher returns elsewhere or to avoid what some see as China’s growing problems.
The outflows are “adding to domestic banking system stresses and weakening the already fragile foundations of the entire financial system,” said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University who was formerly chief of the China division at the International Monetary Fund.
A healthy bond market is crucial to China’s restructuring plans. The country has been counting on its fast-growing bond market as one way to bring market discipline to its traditionally state-directed — and wasteful — economy.
In the mature financial system of the United States, businesses have plenty of ways to get money. They can borrow from a bank, raise money selling stocks or bonds, or seek funds directly from any number of investors.
But in China, state-run banks are by far the main source of funding. That helped power the country’s economic rise, but it also led to loans going to politically connected borrowers rather than to where the economy needed it most. That is one reason the Chinese economy is now stuck with more steel, glass, cement and auto factories than it needs.
Particularly in the past two years, China has taken steps to encourage the development of robust stock and bond markets as well as private lenders, needing a way to ensure the flow of money was being directed by profit-minded investors rather than politicians and their allies at state-owned banks.
The stock market crashed last year, and private lending has been slow to take off. But until this past week, the bond market had performed well. The investment arms of local governments and other large borrowers rushed in recent months to issue bonds at low interest rates and to pay off bank loans issued at higher rates — just as the government intended. Bond issuance jumped 47 percent in the first 11 months of this year from the same period last year.
What the government did not foresee was an explosion of speculative bond trading by Chinese banks.
Banks have increasingly raised money by selling 
, investments that have the look and feel of dependable bank deposits and are usually sold to average investors. Banks rarely disclose what is behind those wealth management products and generally keep them off their books.
Still, it is becoming increasingly clear that many of them are backed by bonds. The bond holdings of wealth management products more than doubled over the 18-month period that ended in June. Adding to the risks, banks are also making large, leveraged bets on the direction of bond prices.
Now the government is moving to rein it in. On Monday evening, The Financial News, a newspaper controlled by China’s central bank, published questions and answers with a central bank official who was identified only as being in charge of the reviews of banks’ financial soundness. The official told the newspaper that starting next year, the central bank would include wealth management products in these reviews.
A press officer at the central bank confirmed that the interview was an accurate reflection of the institution’s views but declined to elaborate.
On Tuesday, the yield on one-year government bonds rose to 3.11 percent, compared with 2.35 percent two weeks ago, a considerable jump for bonds. Yields go up when bond prices go down, and a higher yield makes it more expensive to issue bonds.
Corporate bond yields are also rising fast, as investors have begun demanding a better return from entrusting their money to China’s frequently opaque companies. That reverses a trend from this year, when investors were so enthusiastic for Chinese bonds that they bought corporate bonds as well, narrowing the natural spread between government and corporate bonds.
Mr. Miao, of FXM Brothers, predicted that corporate bonds would continue to sell off until the spread between government corporate yields was wider again.

"BEIJING — The Chinese Navy on Tuesday handed back an American underwater 
 it had seized, returning the device to the United States after days of contention that drew the ire of President-elect 
.
A Chinese vessel returned the submersible drone to a 
 ship in international waters off the Philippines, near where it was taken on Thursday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, Peter Cook, said on the 
.
Since the Pentagon 
 on Friday and demanded the return of the ocean-monitoring device, American and Chinese officials have engaged in verbal sniping over 
, which took place roughly 500 miles from the coast of mainland 
. In the latest announcement, Mr. Cook pressed home the official American position.
“The incident was inconsistent with both international law and standards of professionalism for conduct between navies at sea,” Mr. Cook said. He did not mention what condition the drone was in when it was returned.
Mr. Trump, who 
 with a string of blunt comments on controversial issues including 
, trade and North Korea’s nuclear weapons, also took up the dispute over the drone, which is also called an unmanned underwater vehicle.
But unlike the Pentagon, he suggested that China could keep it. On Saturday, Mr. Trump 
 on Twitter that the seizure was an unprecedented act, and he 
, “We should tell China that we don’t want the drone they stole back.”
China’s opaque policy making, especially on military issues, has left outsiders guessing about who authorized the seizure, whether the act was meant to send a message and, if so, whether that message was aimed at Mr. Trump. But the way in which the Chinese ship fished out the drone with a United States Navy ship nearby suggested a calibrated action, several analysts said.
Mr. Trump has drawn particular ire from Beijing for suggesting he could depart from the One China principle, which blocks Washington from diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The Chinese government insists that it has a sovereign right to Taiwan, which has its own democratically elected government.
“I see the snatched drone as a calculated act of coercive diplomacy approved at the top,” Patrick M. Cronin, the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said in an email.
“I believe Beijing accelerated plans to create an early test for the new administration because Trump publicly called into question the One China policy and because China judged it safer to provoke Obama than an unpredictable Trump,” Mr. Cronin said.
The statement by Mr. Cook, the Pentagon spokesman, made clear that the episode would not shake American determination to maintain a military presence in the South China Sea, where busy shipping lanes intersect with volatile rivalries over territorial claims. He said the United States would “continue to fly, sail and operate in the South China Sea wherever international law allows.”
The Obama administration says the United States does not take sides in the territorial disputes but wants to preserve freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, including for United States Navy ships.
China’s 
 of naval and coast guard forces in the region, and 
 of military facilities on artificially created islands, has alarmed Southeast Asian nations that also claim islands in the sea. The Chinese government says the American presence there is provocative, and it has said so again since the drone was seized.
“China firmly opposes the frequent appearance of U.S. military aircraft and vessels in waters facing China for close-in reconnaissance and military surveys,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
 in Beijing on Monday.
When reporters pressed Ms. Hua on China’s reasoning, she asked, “Are you implying that the South China Sea is in the pocket of the United States?”
But 
 on Tuesday from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense did not mention tensions over the United States presence, merely confirming that it had “smoothly completed” the return of the drone after “friendly consultations.”
Chinese officials have said that their military had a right to pull the drone from the sea more than 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. They said the Chinese ship had done so out of safety concerns for passing vessels. Many foreign experts in international law have scoffed at that explanation.
But the dispute prompted an outburst of condemnation toward American policy from hawkish Chinese commentators. Chinese nationalist ire could grow if Mr. Trump continues challenging Beijing, especially on Taiwan and the South China Sea.
In a commentary published Monday, Fan Jinfa, a commodore with the Chinese Navy, said the seized drone was part of an American effort to map and monitor conditions in the South China Sea to improve tracking of Chinese submarines.
“The undersea battleground, especially in the South China Sea, will become a new domain of Chinese-American rivalry,” Commodore Fan wrote in the commentary published on the website of People’s Daily, a newspaper. He said of the drone dispute: “The malign intent of the Americans in unilaterally and publicly stirring this up was glaringly clear.”",Chinese Navy Returns Seized Underwater Drone to U.S.,"DEC. 20, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/world/asia/china-returns-us-drone.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"BEIJING — 
 has a fakes problem.
On Wednesday, American trade officials said they had added Taobao, the Alibaba Group’s sprawling online shopping bazaar in China, to 
 of the world’s most notorious markets for counterfeit goods. The addition — an embarrassing setback four years after Alibaba successfully lobbied American officials to drop the platform from the list — comes as the owners of brands increasingly complain about the proliferation of fakes on the company’s sales platforms.
It also comes as Alibaba moves to satisfy increasingly sophisticated Chinese consumers who want higher-quality goods — a shift that has also drawn intensifying competition from Alibaba’s rivals.
Alibaba says it has increased efforts to find and eliminate counterfeit goods. In its report on Wednesday, the Office of the United States Trade Representative acknowledged those efforts — but said they were not enough.
Taobao “is an important concern due to the large volume of allegedly counterfeit and pirated goods available and the challenges right holders experience in removing and preventing illicit sales and offers of such goods,” the agency said, citing complaints from brand owners about the proliferation of fakes on Taobao.
“While recent steps set positive expectations for the future,” it added, “current levels of reported counterfeiting and piracy are unacceptably high.”
Alibaba, which maintains that counterfeit goods are an industrywide problem, called the move “counterproductive” and questioned the motives behind the agency’s decision. In a statement from Michael Evans, the president of Alibaba, the company said the decision “leads us to question whether the U.S.T.R. acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate” — an apparent reference to 
 that Donald J. Trump espoused during the campaign and as president-elect.
In an email to the group that oversees how Alibaba’s platforms are governed, Daniel Zhang, the company’s chief executive, pushed the group to continue fighting counterfeiters, whom he described as being “like bacteria in the air that we breathe.” But he also compared the American move to trade 
 and said Alibaba would face similar efforts elsewhere as it expanded.
“It wouldn’t come as a surprise if we encounter other situations similar to that of ‘Notorious Markets’ in the future, where protectionism leads to malicious acts to players in the market,” he wrote in the email, which the company shared publicly.
The decision by the agency, which does not come with any official punishments, will have little practical impact on Alibaba’s main China operations. The company is enjoying 
 as Chinese consumers shrug off the country’s slowing economic growth and continue their online buying spree. In after-hours trading on Wednesday after the announcement, its shares fell less than 1 percent.
But the listing could complicate the Chinese company’s ambitions to move into other markets. Alibaba has made forays into the United States, Southeast Asia and elsewhere, and it is moving into industries like entertainment that could take it further abroad. The listing is also a blemish for a company that symbolized China’s rising sophistication when it held a 
 of stock two years ago in the United States.
The listing represents a stumble in Alibaba’s lobbying efforts in the United States. Four years ago, American officials 
 from the list, citing its efforts to fight fakes. The move came after Alibaba tapped a former official from the trade representative’s office, James Mendenhall, to work on its behalf. Since 2012 it has spent $2.4 million lobbying the American government, according to 
 compiled by 
, a website run by the Center for Responsive Politics.
In recent years Alibaba has de-emphasized Taobao, a vast platform resembling eBay where sellers big and small can set up online stores. Analysts say its growth prospects are limited, and a growing number of Chinese consumers say they want to buy from sources they can better trust.
“The problem is that anybody can open a Taobao shop and sell anything,” said Shaun Rein, the founder and managing director of China Market Research Group.
Yu Yang, an information technology engineer in Beijing, said he had started using Taobao more than a decade ago. “But I almost stopped completely about three or four years ago,” he said, adding that it had become difficult to tell fake from real basketball sneakers, which he collects.
“Fakes are getting more and more real,” said Mr. Yu, 36, who said he had switched to shopping on 
 and also bought more when he traveled to South Korea or Japan. “Unless you compare a fake with an authentic, it would be almost impossible to tell.”
Alibaba said its core Chinese retail business had 439 million annual active users during the year that ended in September, though it did not break out how many of them were Taobao users. That business makes its money by charging fees to, and providing advertising for, vendors.
Alibaba has tried to steer business to its Tmall platform, which is geared toward larger sellers of higher-end name brands like Nike and Estée Lauder. But that business faces intense competition from JD.com and others that manage their own inventory and act more as curators for finicky customers.
Tmall is the dominant player in the business-to-consumer segment, as Tmall and its rivals are called, with a little more than half of the market, according to figures from the data firm iResearch. But the data also shows that it has slowly lost market share to others.
Last year, in a warning to Alibaba, the United States Trade Representative 
 as a source of complaints about fakes, though the platform was not mentioned in this year’s list. Alibaba has also defended Tmall’s efforts to fight fakes.
The American government’s move adds to mounting pressure on Alibaba to do something about fakes. Last year, the owner of the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent brands sued Alibaba in New York federal court, claiming that the company encouraged sales of fakes on its online platforms. In October an industry group, the American Apparel and Footwear Association, and others 
 for Alibaba to be added to the government’s notorious markets list, saying its members saw little change despite the company’s efforts to fight fakes.
In May, the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition 
 from a plan to give Alibaba membership in its ranks as part 
 to fight fakes, after other members objected and raised questions about financial ties between Alibaba and the group’s leadership. The group defended its leadership but said it had hired an outside firm to review its internal controls.",Alibaba Faces Growing Pressure Over Counterfeit Goods,"DEC. 22, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/business/alibaba-ustr-taobao-counterfeit.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CAO LI
"BEIJING — Fresh from school with a degree in hotel management, Luo Haichao left his hometown and moved to Beijing to look for a bigger paycheck. He eventually found one in a different sector: driving cars. China has created its own local versions of Uber and Lyft, and the ride-hailing business is booming.
But now Mr. Luo — and potentially tens of thousands of other drivers — will have to get off the road.
Citing safety and other issues, the cities of Beijing and Shanghai said on Wednesday that Chinese ride-hailing companies must stop using out-of-town drivers like Mr. Luo and hire only local residents to sit behind the wheel.
“It makes me feel sad,” said Mr. Luo, 29, who works for the ride-hailing companies 
 and Yidao Yongche and had just spent about $36,000 on a new Volkswagen Passat to give his passengers a more reliable ride. “Without people who come from the outside, Beijing wouldn’t have developed so fast.”
The new rules could deal a significant blow to Didi Chuxing, China’s ride-hailing giant, and smaller rivals that must now find new — and probably more expensive — drivers in two major markets. Didi Chuxing had 
 in an expensive battle for dominance in the world’s largest ride-hailing market, and it enjoys such a high global profile that it counts 
 and other big names among its investors.
In a statement, Didi said the rules represented a “significant step toward a more sensible and liberal framework,” and were less limiting on pricing, cars and driver restrictions than earlier drafts. A spokeswoman declined to comment on how the Beijing and Shanghai residency requirements for drivers would affect its business.
China’s technology boom has put the country 
 and transformed the lives of many of its nearly 1.4 billion people. But even the new parts of the Chinese economy depend in part on the same old fuel that powered the country’s rise for decades: 
.
Those workers — now totaling nearly 280 million, including Mr. Luo — 
 their farms, villages and smaller cities to seek factory jobs and better lives in the big cities. Their hands, low wages and willingness to work helped make China the world’s factory floor.
Increasingly, many of those workers do the grunt work behind China’s internet success stories. They drive cars for 
 and Yidao Yongche, deliver packages for 
 and 
, and fetch takeout meals for 
 and Eleme. Without them, China’s thriving e-commerce industry could take a significant hit.
But the new ride-share regulations show that the technology industry in China is coming up against long-held concerns in the country about overcrowding, a widening wealth gap and access to education, health care and other services.
“At the bottom of the conflict is tension between powerful vested interests and a new rising class,” said Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. The political power of China’s taxi services — which see ride-hailing companies as dangerous rivals — presents a particularly strong challenge, he said.
It is not clear how many drivers would be affected, but the numbers could be significant. In Shanghai, for instance, fewer than 10,000 of the 410,000 active drivers registered to Didi Chuxing have permanent residency papers, according to Didi. Also on Wednesday, the southern boomtown of Guangzhou joined cities that had previously instituted less-restrictive residency requirements. In its statement, Didi said the city of Beijing had given it five months to implement the rules.
Officials in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment. But they were quoted by local news outlets citing safety concerns and a need to track drivers, as in the case a year ago, when a 28-year-old Beijing ride-share driver made headlines when he punched a drunk passenger, breaking an eye socket. The officials were also mentioned as citing local regulations already in place that require taxi drivers to be residents of the city where they work.
At issue is China’s unique household registration — or hukou — system, which was intended to keep rural workers from flooding into more populous regions. The larger cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, need a steady influx of people like Mr. Luo to function.
But residents or officials often push back, worried that migrants could swamp schools, hospitals and other services. Chinese cities have long struggled with how to square the need for migrant labor with the hukou system, and the country is slowly moving toward 
 for migrants to 
.
The ride-hailing business poses especially tricky concerns for local governments. Taxi drivers, who are required to be local residents, feel threatened and have flexed their political muscle. In some cities, taxi drivers have gone on strike, sometimes harassing ride-share drivers.
That has discouraged some ride-share drivers. “There are fewer and fewer rewards,” said Wen Zhenjiang, 37, who worked for Didi and Uber in Beijing for nearly two years and is now looking for work driving trucks.
There are other reasons to leave. Driving full-time often means 14- to 15-hour shifts each day, sometimes overnight if there is strong demand. Most drivers rent vehicles, but some — like Mr. Luo — bought their own after they started to make good money. To save on rent, many share apartments in the suburbs.
Their employers don’t keep tabs on how often the drivers work or require them to reach driving quotas. However, if they get bad ratings from passengers, they risk losing bonus payments.
Still, the rewards of getting into the ride-hailing business are clear: Mr. Luo has occasionally earned about $4,350 in a month, or three times more than the average Beijing office worker.
On Wednesday, online groups devoted to ride-share drivers were filled with messages of anger and disappointment. Many said they would return to driving illegal taxis. ”That will probably make me more money,” wrote a driver named Xiaowei. Another, named Canyue, said, “Whatever the rule is, I will keep driving as long as I can still tap ‘start a service’ on my app.”
Mr. Luo has a lot at stake. He is married and has an apartment and a mortgage back home in Chengde County in Hebei Province. His living is a good one for someone with a rural hukou. He is still making monthly payments equal to about $290 on his car and paying the same amount on his mortgage.
“This is unfair to people from outside Beijing,” he said.
But his days in the business are probably numbered, he said on Wednesday. “If it isn’t allowed, I will stop driving,” he said. “What can I do? I can’t put all my eggs in one basket.”",China’s New Ride-Hailing Rules Focus on Where Drivers Call Home,"DEC. 21, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/business/china-didi-driver-rules-uber.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CAO LI
"BEIJING — Both came to power vowing to restore their nations to greatness. But America’s loud, ad-libbing president-elect, 
, and 
’s guarded, calculating president, 
, are glaring contrasts as politicians, and their pairing has injected new unpredictability into relations between their governments.
“I could not think of two more different protagonists in the great drama of U.S.-China relations,” 
, formerly the senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said by email. “Personalities matter a lot in international relations, especially between great powers.”
A quarrel after 
 from the United States Navy has given a taste of how Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Xi’s different styles could play out if bigger tensions were to break out over the South China Sea, trade imbalances, North Korea’s nuclear weapons or other issues that Mr. Trump has raised.
Mr. Trump has recently blared warnings at China, seemingly guided by visceral reflexes and a vague but bold set of demands. By contrast, Mr. Xi, the 
, is disciplined and steely. He rarely speaks off the cuff in public. Even his seemingly impromptu gestures are often carefully choreographed, and he usually adheres to policy points when meeting foreign leaders. Mr. Xi is certainly capable of bold action, as he has shown in the South China Sea, but he tends to shroud his thinking in a cloud of slogans. That leaves outsiders guessing about when and how he will act on his demands.
“The situation could become quite combustible,” said 
, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy.
“
 is more measured in his public statements than 
, but the Chinese government will likely hit back quite forcefully against any radical efforts to challenge the status quo,” Ms. Weiss said. “The best thing the president-elect’s advisers can do for our national security is to screen Trump’s tweets.”
Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Saturday after the Chinese military confirmed that it had seized a submersible drone in waters about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The Pentagon had 
, and 
 said it would return the device, which can be used to monitor undersea currents and conditions, in an “appropriate manner.”
Mr. Trump suggested that wasn’t good enough. 
 was an unprecedented act, and 
, “We should tell China that we don’t want the drone they stole back.”
Mr. Trump did not say how he would handle similar disputes after he is sworn. But his other comments so far suggest that he will take a blunter, less predictable course on China than recent White House administrations.
This month, Mr. Trump spoke on the 
, the president of Taiwan, breaking nearly 40 years of American presidents and presidents-elect avoiding direct conversation with the leader of the island, over which China claims sovereignty.
In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump then suggested he could depart from the One China principle, which blocks Washington from diplomatic ties with Taiwan, using that as a 
 to seek trade concessions from Beijing. He also criticized China on trade, the buildup of military outposts in the South China Sea and its reluctance to isolate North Korea.
“China is not used to the U.S. asserting and pushing its interests like the Chinese do,” said 
, the director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, who praised Mr. Trump’s blunter approach. “If it is prepared for that, we will be able to avoid confrontation and conflict.”
So far, Mr. Xi has not reacted publicly to Mr. Trump’s warnings. The two men had a brief but 
 after Mr. Trump won the election. Chinese leaders rarely wade openly into disputes, leaving that to junior officials. But pressure for a tougher reaction to Mr. Trump could build in China if he keeps lobbing out warnings, especially after he becomes president.
Experts disagreed over whether China’s seizure of the submersible drone was intended as a signal to Mr. Trump, or even authorized by Mr. Xi. But Chinese decision makers probably took into account that Mr. Trump’s team would read it as “a test and a warning,” said 
, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.
“It would be impossible for China not to react to his provocations,” Mr. Ni said by telephone. “Trump seems to want a foreign policy that keeps the other side guessing. But that way of working can easily lead to trouble.”
On Monday, an 
 in a prominent Communist Party newspaper said that Mr. Xi’s government needed to be ready for rockier relations.
“Trump hits out with a hammer to the east and a club to the west, and his real thinking is very difficult to fathom,” said the editorial in the overseas edition of the paper, People’s Daily, using a Chinese saying that means to speak or act without rhyme or reason. China, it said, should “stay steady on its feet, keep a good grasp of developments, calmly respond, and that’s it.”
But even China’s calls for calm have barbs and caveats that could rile a Trump administration.
When the Chinese defense ministry said it would return the submersible drone, it also said the Chinese ship showed a “professional and responsible attitude” by seizing the device, although the drone 
 even an extremely expansive view of China’s rightful reach in the South China Sea.
Chinese hard-liners are already urging a harsher response to Mr. Trump. On Saturday, Global Times, a newspaper often dominated by anti-American rhetoric, 
 where speakers urged tough retaliation if Mr. Trump moved closer to Taiwan, and praised the seizure of the underwater drone.
“China isn’t afraid of confrontation with America,” 
, a former Chinese Air Force senior colonel and outspoken hawk, said at the meeting. “Without China’s cooperation, Trump will achieve nothing. I dare say that if he opts for confrontation with China, he won’t stay in office for more than four years.”
Another speaker, Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, 
: “China is a dragon. America is an eagle. Britain is a lion. When the dragon wakes up, the others are all snacks.”
Such tough talk does not set Chinese foreign policy, but Mr. Xi and other leaders are sensitive to nationalist ire that they themselves have nurtured. Mr. Xi has summed up his vision of national rejuvenation and strength as the “
,’’ a theme he has promoted since taking office.
Pressures on Mr. Xi are likely to grow if Mr. Trump continues publicly excoriating China, especially on territorial issues, like Taiwan and the South China Sea, where public sentiment often favors a tough response.
“China tends to give the new leader a grace period to settle in,” Ms. Weiss said, citing 
 about China’s response to elections and new leaders. “Trump has moved more quickly to challenge and defy China than other president-elects, however, so the grace period could end quickly.”
American presidents know how swiftly relations with China can deteriorate.
In 1999, President Bill Clinton 
 after NATO bombs struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, then the capital of Yugoslavia, killing three people. The White House insisted the bombing 
, but the Chinese government did not believe that, and days of 
 followed.
In 2001, a United States Navy reconnaissance plane made an emergency landing on Hainan, a Chinese island-province jutting into the South China Sea, after 
 with a Chinese Air Force jet whose pilot plunged to his death. Eleven days later, China released the 24 American crew members, and the plane was recovered in parts over the following months.
A scenario like that could unfold very differently under Mr. Trump.
“If Trump perceives that he is being challenged, he will probably instinctively not want to be seen as weak,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It will be very messy if he decides to tweet or speak publicly in a crisis before he has all the intelligence and analysis necessary.”
Mr. Xi also has his domestic political timetable to worry about. He was appointed head of the Communist Party in 2012, and next year a party congress is all but certain to give him five more years in that job. But Mr. Xi must 
 of senior officials to work under him, and during elite shake-ups the party leadership puts even more emphasis on stability.
“The leadership has to balance those goals of preserving a more stable and predictable external environment with avoiding the perception of weakness and vulnerability,” Ms. Glaser said. “I tend to believe that the latter will trump the former if the Chinese leadership has to choose. Pun intended.”",Trump’s and Xi’s Differences Magnify Uncertainties Between U.S. and China,"DEC. 19, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/world/asia/-china-donald-trump-power.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"BEIJING — The ominous images in the video pile up, set to darkly urgent music. Refugees fleeing failed uprisings in the Middle East. Western diplomats and politicians cast as puppet masters of subversion in

The video, which spread on the internet this week, has been widely promoted online by public security offices that oversee the police, including an office of the central Ministry of Public Security. But who ordered its production is unclear. An earlier version surfaced online in August but disappeared from the internet, only to resurface in its current version.
Attempts to contact the makers, whose working name, Gewuzhijian, appears at the end of the video and also on Weibo, a Chinese social media service, went unanswered.
The video is a seven-and-a-half-minute phantasmagoria of the Communist Party’s nightmares of Western subversion. The video does not have an official title, but it has been promoted online under the question “Who most wants to overthrow China?”
“Color revolution” is the party’s thumbnail term for these fears, and the video, while shoddily made, offers a vivid lesson in how threats to party control — real or imagined — that can seem unrelated to outsiders are often seen inside the party as calculated moves in a grand plot, orchestrated from Washington, to bring it down.
The term “color revolution” first gained currency in China to describe antigovernment insurrections in former Soviet bloc countries, which Chinese officials have said were coups inspired by the United States. The party says such uprisings are a template of Western plans for China.
This conspiratorial worldview is more than bombast. It is a longstanding theme that has gained 
 under President 
.
That perspective has threaded through the 
 and rights advocates convicted and sentenced on subversion charges this year. It was echoed in a 
 about strengthening ideological controls in Chinese universities. A law governing foreign nongovernment organizations that takes effect on Jan. 1 was also partly 
 of foreign subversion.
“The first option for hostile forces infiltrating us is our education system,” the Chinese minister of education, 
, 
 in remarks published this month. “To wreck your future, first of all they wreck your schools.”
China has been exposed to the world through trade, travel and the internet, and its citizens are in many ways increasingly sophisticated. Even so, party propaganda remains deeply bound to the view that China faces not just disparate critics and foes, but a closely meshed conspiracy that unites those forces. The video is an especially feverish dose of that worldview.
It says plotters and subversives are “stirring up mass incidents and using social tensions as a point to break through and serve as the fuse for ‘color revolution.’ ” They are, the video says, “using foreign nongovernmental organizations to nurture ‘proxies’ and to establish a social basis for ‘color revolution.’ ”
Hong Kong, in particular, is depicted as a bridgehead for Western subversion in China. The pro-democracy law professor 
, the media entrepreneur 
, the student leader 
 and others are lined up as among those “making Hong Kong into a base for ‘color revolution.’ ”
The video also refers briefly to booksellers from Hong Kong who were abducted and 
 last year, prompting an outcry in Hong Kong, which is supposed to have substantial legal autonomy as a self-administered Chinese territory. The video says the booksellers, who specialized in lurid and wildly imaginative accounts of China’s political elite, had “traduced the images” of party leaders.
Under Mr. Xi, who assumed power four years ago, such videos have become an important part in the party’s propaganda arsenal. “
,” produced by China’s National Defense University and issued in 2014, was even more breathless in its 
.
But the new video ends on a reassuring note. The dark images and language give way to swelling melodies and images of a bright dawn over the Great Wall. There are pictures of smiling people and of muscular People’s Liberation Army troops.
“Thoroughly expelling ‘color revolution’ from China will be a long war,” the video warns. But at the end it declares, “If there is war, we will answer the call.”",Chinese Propaganda Video Warns of West’s ‘Devilish Claws’,"DEC. 22, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/asia/china-video-communist-party.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"BEIJING — As the grimy, gray smog spreading across northern 
 settled on the town of Linqi, its schools received a “
” notice to cancel classes and protect children from the acrid haze. But Linqi No. 1 Middle School decided it would go ahead with exams it holds outside.
On the school’s small sports field, at least 400 children sat or knelt this week in front of stools used as small desks, answering questions about math, English, Chinese and physics. It is common in China to hold exams outdoors, to deter cheating. But in this case, the students were bathed in cold, filthy air so dense that those at the back of the soccer field seemed like ghostly imprints in the air.
 of the smog-shrouded testing on Monday spread across the internet in China. The pictures, taken by an irate Linqi resident, drew the attention of the news media and public ire on Wednesday, after days of unusually heavy pollution fell across parts of the country’s north, including Henan Province, which includes Linqi.
The students mostly wore flimsy masks that afford little protection against pollutants, and they quickly came to symbolize the frustration that people express about the smog and the foot-dragging response by some officials.
A reporter from Dahe News, a Henan newspaper that first 
 being held despite the pollution alert, said that he had asked the principal of the Linqi school why students were made to take the test on Monday.
“All the organization had been done,” the principal, Feng Jisheng, replied, according to the reporter. “So we went ahead with the exam.”
“At the time, the smog wasn’t bad,” Mr. Feng said, describing it as being more of an icy fog than smog. Dahe News said that Mr. Feng had denied planning to hold exams outdoors on Tuesday, too.
Much of the attention in the latest pollution wave has focused on Beijing, which issued a rare 
 on Friday. But the pictures from Linqi drove home how much other, often ignored, towns and cities must endure. Dozens of places in China have issued red alerts, the highest-level response, which requires schools to send students home.
In Shijiazhuang, a city in the adjacent Hebei Province, the pollution index for PM2.5 — tiny airborne particles of soot and dirt that are especially hazardous to health — 
 on Monday. Even then, schools in the city 
 until a belated official government notice was sent.
The World Health Organization 
 maximum daily exposure of 25 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter. Even at relatively clear times, the levels in many Chinese cities are much higher. On Wednesday, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection said that 28 cities were under red alert for heavy air pollution, but that the haze and smog would probably start to dissipate on Thursday.
The Chinese government has promised to clean up the air, after public anger swelled in recent years. And there has been progress, although each winter brings 
. This year, a resurgence of steel-making and other heavy industry seems to have cut into gains in reducing pollution.
Many Chinese people reacted to the melancholy images from Linqi much as they have to the smog: with a mixture of anger and mordant irony. While outdoor testing is often used to make it easier to spot students copying others, or peeking at cheat sheets, some commenters questioned the practice this time.
“On a day like that, would teachers be able to spot if students brought cheat sheets?” asked 
 of Sina Weibo, a popular microblog site that is a bit like Twitter.
“China needs this kind of behavior, right? Because gross domestic product is more important than ordinary folks’ health,” another commented.
The Chinese government often tries to mollify public anger by suspending or firing officials, even when the rights and wrongs of a case are unclear. Mr. Feng, for example, was 
 on Wednesday.
Calls to the school went unanswered on Wednesday, but an official in the local education bureau confirmed Mr. Feng’s suspension.
“He didn’t follow our notice to suspend classes at school,” said the official, who gave only his surname, Zhang. “Our notice said all school activities must be suspended from noon on Dec. 19 until the day the red alert is gone.”
Still, the students who endured the outdoor exams do not have to worry too much about the results. The Dahe News reporter said he had asked Mr. Feng why the exams were so pressing.
It was just a test to see how the students were progressing, Mr. Feng replied, according to the report. “It wasn’t that urgent.”","Smog Grips China, but Exam Goes on Outdoors","DEC. 21, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/asia/china-smog-exam-pupils.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"HONG KONG — Before this week, few Chinese citizens had probably heard of São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa. But the country has risen into their good graces after deciding to sever diplomatic ties with 
, a self-governing island that 
 regards as a breakaway province.
The decision, 
 on Wednesday, reduces the number of countries that have formal relations with Taiwan to 21. It comes after Taiwan’s president, 
, who took office in May, 
 in early December and startled Beijing by speaking with the American president-elect, Donald J. Trump.
“China appreciates and welcomes São Tomé and Príncipe’s return to the right track of the one-China principle,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
 on Wednesday.
Beijing has long refused to have diplomatic relations with any country that does not recognize it as China’s sole government. Taiwan, where the defeated Chinese Nationalist forces retreated after the civil war in 1949, is formally known as the Republic of China. For decades, Beijing and Taipei competed for recognition as the country named “China,’’ but in 1979 the United States switched its support and formally established diplomatic relations with Beijing, and most countries have since done the same.
Analysts said São Tomé and Príncipe could be just the first diplomatic defection by a small country eager to establish formal relations with Beijing instead of Taipei, as China is increasingly seen as the richer benefactor.
“I think it might trigger a domino effect,” 
, a professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong, said in an email on Thursday. He added that Beijing was “increasingly determined to squeeze Taipei’s international space” in response to the election of Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan.
At a news briefing in Taipei on Wednesday, Taiwan’s foreign minister, David Lee, declined to provide details of how São Tomé and Príncipe, a former Portuguese colony with a population of less than 200,000, had arrived at its decision to sever diplomatic ties. Ms. Hua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, did not say when the African country would formally establish diplomatic relations with Beijing.
Reports in Taiwan’s news media suggested that São Tomé and Príncipe’s decision had come from Taipei’s refusal to agree to a request for financial support. Taiwan’s state-run Central News Agency 
 at the Foreign Ministry as saying that São Tomé and Príncipe had sought $200 million from Taipei as part of what the agency’s report called “checkbook diplomacy.”
But 
, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said São Tomé’s decision to switch diplomatic allegiance had probably been orchestrated by Beijing and had broader political overtones.
“It looks like something inconsequential, but actually it means a lot for cross-strait relations,” Mr. Zhang said, referring to the body of water that separates Taiwan from the Chinese mainland. “Basically it means Beijing has a new Taiwan strategy: They’re going back to their confrontational style, and the truce with Taiwan over the past eight years is over.”
Ms. Tsai’s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, had promoted closer ties with China.
Mr. Zhang said that before Ms. Tsai took office, Beijing had reportedly denied requests by several African and Latin American countries to establish formal diplomatic relations with Beijing instead of Taipei. The purpose at the time, he said, was to reward Mr. Ma for his role in stabilizing relations between China and Taiwan and to help him avoid “embarrassing” diplomatic episodes that could damage his domestic political capital.
Mr. Zhang added that the move by São Tomé and Príncipe could be read as “part of China’s punishment of Tsai for calling Trump.”
When Mr. Trump answered a congratulatory telephone call from Ms. Tsai this month, he became the first American president or president-elect 
 since at least 1979. Mr. Trump later said that he viewed the “One China’’ policy that has informed relations between Washington and Beijing since the 1970s as ripe for review, and Beijing responded by blaming Ms. Tsai’s government for arranging the call.
On Thursday, Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, 
 was merely a beginning, and that Taiwan could lose all of its diplomatic partners if the Democratic Progressive Party “continues to pursue Taiwan independence.”
On Sina Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, people welcomed the African country into the Chinese fold, even as some conceded that their grasp of its geography was hazy.

"BEIJING — Five law enforcement officers in Beijing will not stand trial over the death of a Chinese environmentalist, even though prosecutors found that they broke the law by misusing force, delaying medical care and lying about the circumstances of his death, officials said on Friday.
The news was the latest turn in the controversial case of Lei Yang, a 29-year-old with a newborn daughter whose death in May 
 over police brutality. The 
 — describing a chain of mistakes and misdeeds by the officers, but declining to put them on trial — appeared likely to renew contention over the case.
“The circumstances of the criminality were slight and they were able to acknowledge and repent their crimes,” the procuratorate, or prosecutors’ office, of Fengtai district in south Beijing, said of the officers. The announcement did not give their full names. Two were police officers who were 
. One other was an auxiliary officer, and two more were security guards employed by the police.
The team of officers caught Mr. Lei near a foot massage parlor on the northern outskirts of Beijing. His family and supporters insisted that the police had entrapped him, invented accusations that Mr. Lei had paid for sex at the parlor, and lied about how he died.
To his supporters, Mr. Lei symbolized how even middle-class Chinese citizens are vulnerable to abuses of power by unaccountable authority figures. He held a master’s degree from 
 in Beijing and worked for an environmental group affiliated with the government, thus standing out from the blue-collar and rural residents who most often accuse the police of brutality.
But the district prosecutors’ office, which was assigned to decide whether to take the case further after an investigation 
, said the officers’ misdeeds were not grave enough to merit a trial.
“The investigation has found that the policing personnel involved were carrying out public duties according to the law,” the office said in a 
 that accompanied its decision. “The rumors that spread on the internet about a ‘payback attack’ and ‘entrapment in law enforcement’ had no basis in fact.”
Mr. Lei’s family could not be reached Friday, and a lawyer helping the family in the case, Chen Youxi, did not answer phone calls or messages. But they and Mr. Lei’s other supporters, many of them alumni of Renmin University, seem unlikely to be satisfied with the prosecutors’ decision.
Still, the government is unlikely to back down, said Liang Xiaojun, a lawyer in Beijing who often takes on contentious legal rights cases.
“This case is already more than a simple one. It’s been escalated to a high level of stability maintenance,” Mr. Liang said by telephone, using government jargon for maintaining social control. “Lei Yang’s family can appeal, but that’s going to be tough, because this was not a decision that could have been made just by the lower procuratorate.”
According to the prosecutors’ account, one evening in May, the five officers went out in plain clothes as part of a crackdown on prostitution. Mr. Lei, according to this account, was questioned by the officers after he had left a foot massage parlor. In China, such parlors sometimes double as brothels, and the prosecutors said the evidence and interviews showed that Mr. Lei had sex with a prostitute in the parlor. His family said that was unthinkable for Mr. Lei.
According to prosecutors, Mr. Lei tried to run away, but the officers tackled him. He “fiercely resisted,” and officers grabbed his hair, wrapped an arm around his neck and pressed down on his head and limbs. After the officers put him in a police vehicle, the prosecutors said, Mr. Lei tried to escape again, and again the officers piled on.
“Later, Lei stopped shouting and he no longer put up resistance,” the prosecutors’ account said. “His physical responses showed clear changes and he went limp.”
The officers did not immediately take Mr. Lei to a hospital or give emergency aid. By the time they took him to a hospital, there were no signs of life, and doctors pronounced him dead late that night. Earlier accounts said Mr. Lei died of a heart attack, but the latest statement said he asphyxiated on the contents of his own stomach that entered his respiratory tract.
“Subsequently, they deliberately concocted facts, concealed the truth and obstructed the investigation,” the prosecutors said of the officers.
Despite all that, the law enforcement officers had not “deliberately beaten him to death,” Mr. Lei had resisted the law and the officers had shown contrition, the announcement said. The prosecutors recommended that the men face internal police discipline.

"SHANGHAI
WITH the nausea came a sense of frustration. Earlier this year, Xu Caiyuan watched helplessly as the numbers flashed across a computer screen in his office in Shanghai’s glittering financial district.
The Chinese stock market was 
. In a spectacular crash just months earlier, it had wiped out significant assets of professional investors like himself and the life savings of many ordinary citizens. The instability spread to global markets.
“During the stock market plunge, many middle-class investors lost their money, and they don’t know why,” Mr. Xu, 38, said over lunch in a Southeast Asian restaurant overlooking a park in Shanghai’s French Concession. “The reason the market plummeted is because this is a man-made disaster.”
“I think there’s a human factor behind the stock market crash,” he added. “The crash took me by surprise. I thought, ‘This isn’t normal.’”
Long a shareholder advocate, Mr. Xu is now waging a battle against 
 in hopes of punishing the officials he blames for the twin disasters, which shook world indexes in summer 2015 and this January.
Mr. Xu’s target is the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which came under intense criticism from investors and some officials for withholding or misrepresenting information and enacting emergency trading controls that contributed to the terrible losses suffered by investors. Its chairman, 
, was fired from his post in February.
The market instability led global analysts and many investors here to ask whether the Communist Party was 
 as well as the broader economy.
In the wake of the market crashes, Mr. Xu has emerged as the face of investor frustration as he tries to sue the agency, known widely as the 
. Chinese news organizations have published a stream of articles about Mr. Xu this year. Several Chinese news sites have called Mr. Xu the “big brother helping to protect rights.” CNBC, the American financial television news network, did a 
 on him.
In person, Mr. Xu does not look like a legal brawler. A slim, short man, he showed up to lunch wearing hip glasses and a navy suit with white dots. But as he pulled out documents related to his lawsuit and spoke about them in sharp bursts, his combative side became evident.
“I don’t know if there will be justice, but I can choose to do things,” he said. “The reason we appealed to the courts is we trust in the courts and the legal system.”
Mr. Xu had already achieved some prominence in financial circles as an activist investor, known for bringing lawsuits against companies he had invested in that he thought had failed to act in the best interests of shareholders.
His attempt to sue the C.S.R.C. after the January 2016 crash was different, because he was taking on the government. A lower court and a high court rejected the lawsuit this year, despite the news media coverage. In October, he filed an appeal with the Supreme People’s Court, hoping the judges would force a lower court to hear the case.
He has been traveling between Shanghai and Beijing all year to deal with the courts, and now awaits an answer.
Zhang Ren, a lawyer at the Beijing Century Law Firm who has been advising Mr. Xu, said the government’s attempts to ignore Mr. Xu’s lawsuit “are embarrassing.”
“And the Intermediate Court’s negligence is embarrassing, too,” he added, referring to a lower court in Beijing that rejected Mr. Xu’s lawsuit.
Mr. Zhang said the case was one that could be a legal marker. “When 
 becomes more democratic and respects the rule of law, this could be a precedent,” he said.
Another lawyer, Liang Min, disagreed, saying Mr. Xu was pushing a “sensationalistic” case with no basis in proper administrative law.
Mr. Xu comes from Wenzhou, in Zhejiang Province in southeastern China, known as a hotbed of entrepreneurship. The youngest of three children, Mr. Xu attended Huadong Normal University in Shanghai, where he studied management. He said he began investing in stocks in 1998, even before he had graduated.
“At the time, I would look through the financial reports and annual reports of listed companies and make decisions,” he said.
AFTER graduation, he worked several years as a university administrator, then became a full-time investor and eventually started a company to manage investment funds. He now has a small office in the Lujiazui neighborhood, the center of Shanghai’s financial industry.
He manages two private equity funds, both named after him: Caiyuan No. 1 and Caiyuan No. 2. He belongs to a Wenzhou business association in Shanghai — it is common for Wenzhou entrepreneurs to band together in cities where they live — and to an investors’ group in Lujiazui.
Mr. Xu said that the funds weathered the market crashes and that his lawsuit was tied solely to his personal investments. He declined to say how much money he lost in the market turmoil, but said some friends had lost the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars.
Mr. Xu became a public figure in 2008, when he led a shareholder suit against Gangfan, a state-owned steel company based in Sichuan Province that was undergoing restructuring, accusing it of wrongly failing to buy back stock warrants held by investors. A local court ruled in favor of the shareholders. The central government agency in charge of state-owned enterprises then ordered Gangfan to pay the investors 7 billion renminbi, or more than $1 billion.
The victory made news. Since then, Mr. Xu has brought a half-dozen similar lawsuits. In 2010, he was named a “Wenzhou Economic Figure” by Wenzhou Economic Newspaper for his efforts to protect shareholders’ rights.
“Some of the listed companies, when they see me, they avoid me like the plague,” he said. “A regulatory body, for example the C.S.R.C., it has headaches.”
Not all of the lawsuits have been successful. He failed in an attempt to sue a pharmaceuticals company in Inner Mongolia with large property holdings — “This company was set to be a big enterprise in Inner Mongolia, so I think it had influence,” he said.
Police officers in Inner Mongolia called Mr. Xu to question him over the telephone. Officers in Shanghai did the same.
Through the years, Mr. Xu has continued investing. “I don’t think I’m an opportunist,” he said. “I think I’ve always invested based on the value of the companies.”
The case Mr. Xu is trying to make against the China Securities Regulatory Commission is not an easy one. Mr. Xu said he believed the market crashed in part because state-owned enterprises sold large holdings and withdrew from the market under cover from the agency, which reassured people that big investors were staying in the market.
He also said the C.S.R.C. had issued a statement called Document No. 21, in which its head, Mr. Xiao, said that a large state securities company would keep up its investments to stabilize the market. That turned out not to be true, Mr. Xu said — in reality, the company and other state-owned enterprises sold off stocks.
The C.S.R.C. spokesman did not respond to multiple calls made to his office on Friday seeking comment.
Mr. Xu also tried to file a second lawsuit against the agency, this one accusing the agency of not disclosing information properly. The First Intermediate Court accepted the case in September, but then last month reversed itself. Mr. Xu said he was also appealing that decision.
“I think Wenzhou people are very persistent,” Mr. Xu said. “They can endure hardship. They don’t surrender to failure.”",A Bruised Investor Seeks Justice for China’s Market Turmoil,"DEC. 23, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/world/asia/a-bruised-investor-seeks-justice-for-chinas-market-turmoil.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EDWARD WONG
"BEIJING — General Motors’s main joint venture in China was fined $29 million on Friday on charges that it suppressed competition by enforcing minimum sales prices for dealers. It is the latest in a string of penalties against non-Chinese auto brands under the country’s antimonopoly law.
Chinese regulators have punished companies in several industries, likemilk and medical devices, under the 2008 law in what appears to be an effort to force down consumer prices.
G.M. had announced in August 2014 that Shanghai G.M., its joint venture with the state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, was under investigation by antimonopoly regulators.
The Shanghai Price Bureau said that Shanghai G.M. improperly hurt competition by enforcing minimum prices dealers were allowed to charge for Cadillac, Chevrolet and Buick models.
That “disrupted the normal order of market competition,” said a statement by the price bureau.
Setting minimum retail prices is a common practice in many markets, but lawyers say Chinese regulators appear to regard it as an improper restraint on competition.
The price bureau’s statement said the penalty was set at 4 percent of Shanghai G.M.’s annual sales, or 201 million yuan, about $29 million.
G.M. vies with Volkswagen for the status of the top-selling vehicle brand in China.
Sales of G.M. vehicles in China are up 8.5 percent so far this year, to 3.4 million.
“G.M. fully respects local laws and regulations wherever we operate,” the company said in a statement. “We will provide full support to our joint venture in China to ensure that all responsive and appropriate actions are taken with respect to this matter.”
President-elect Donald J. Trump has criticized Chinese trade practices, but there was no indication the case was linked to that.
Audi, Volkswagen’s luxury unit, was fined $40.5 million, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Chrysler brand received a smaller penalty in 2014 on similar charges of enforcing minimum sales prices.
State media cited an official saying Daimler Benz’s Mercedes unit was guilty of violations, but no penalty was announced. Toyota Motor Corporation said its Lexus unit was under scrutiny, but no results have been announced.
The industrywide investigation began in 2014 after complaints of foreign auto brands abusing their control over supplies of spare parts to overcharge consumers. In the case of Mercedes, regulators said purchasing the spare parts needed to assemble one car would cost as much as 12 new vehicles.",G.M.’s Venture in China Fined $29 Million Under Antimonopoly Law,"DEC. 23, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/business/gm-china-penalty.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
"SHANGHAI — Wang Bin looked down. A man wearing a blue skintight unitard writhed at his feet. Mr. Wang grinned. This was the moment he had been waiting for.
So, too, had Cheng Shi. When Mr. Wang lifted the writhing man and slammed him to the floor for a three-count, it completed Mr. Cheng’s dream of watching a professional wrestler — battling in that most American of 
 spectacles — who hailed from China.
“I feel very proud and excited to see him onstage tonight, and so do all the fans,” Mr. Cheng, a 21-year-old student who makes fan videos for a Chinese audience, said before the match. He pointed at the screen of his smartphone to indicate the thousands of people watching him on his live broadcast. “We are very, very excited.”
Looking for eyeballs and new money sources, 
 — the company that brought 
 and 
 into American living rooms — has grand ambitions for a bigger but much more difficult market. It has started a new service live-streaming Chinese-language matches and commentary. It is also combing China’s provinces for more beefy talent like Mr. Wang.
China presents formidable challenges. Entertainment names like 
 and 
 have taken aim at China’s population of 1.4 billion only to run afoul of the country’s tight controls over media. Wrestling’s cartoon violence and sometimes salacious story lines could attract unwanted attention from the government. And while it has its fans, American-style wrestling-as-scripted-entertainment is largely unheard-of among mainland Chinese.
“There is no presence of product over here,” said 
, the square-jawed wrestler and action movie star who has learned to speak some Chinese as part of the push. By tackling the language, he added, “I’m kind of a vehicle to leverage what we’ve done.”
Wrestling’s answer is to go local — and digital. Bypassing state-controlled broadcast television, it has teamed with a video-streaming company to reach fans though computers and mobile devices.
It has also geared up efforts to introduce a new audience to the suplex, the body slam and the drop-kick. W.W.E. has hired four full-time social media directors in Shanghai to maintain local-language social media accounts for its wrestlers and executives. It is also hosting viewing parties, like one this month in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, in which locals devoured pizza and cream sodas while watching a pay-per-view wrestling match and playing the W.W.E.’s latest Xbox video game.
Success requires exposing Chinese audiences to a new type of entertainment — a choreographed drama in which the outcome is known, though its 
 and 
 are sometimes shockingly real.
“They’ve never really seen anything like us,” said Paul Levesque, W.W.E.’s executive in charge of talent and live events, who is also a partly retired wrestler better known as 
. “The athleticism is very real. The story lines and the theater part of it is where they had a hard time with the blurred line of that.”
To friends unfamiliar with wrestling, “I find that the shortest way to tell them is to say it’s an American version — a global version — of the kung fu novel,” said Jay Li, a longtime executive at multinational companies in China who in April 
. as its general manager for greater China. “They get it immediately, because they immediately have a cultural connection and a mental image of what this is about.”
While a lot of attention has been placed in recent years on the expansion into Hollywood of Chinese companies like 
, most foreign entertainment firms struggle to make comparable inroads in China. For some, like 
 has meant giving the Communist Party greater say over its business on the mainland.
Sports — or something that looks like a sport — might be different. Sports enjoys thematic support from the government, which is big on hosting international events like the Olympics and promoting sports like soccer. China’s push to get soccer into schools and 
 has led companies to 
 for broadcast rights.
“Sports has historically been underdeveloped in China and online, and a lot of players are looking for ways to monetize that,” said Vivek Couto, a founder and a director at Media Partners Asia, an industry research consultant.
Professional wrestling could use the eyeballs. Like other media companies, W.W.E. is grappling with the new world of cord-cutting, in which viewers drop their cable subscriptions and order shows, à la carte, via the internet.
International viewers offer one potential growth area. They make up only about a quarter of the paid subscribers on W.W.E.’s digital subscription service, which is one of the biggest contributors to the company’s bottom line.
As China shows, international growth isn’t always easy. In October, W.W.E. told investors it was still waiting to offer subscriptions directly to Chinese viewers.
For now it works with a Chinese video company service called PPTV, which streams the company’s weekly flagship shows, called “SmackDown” and “RAW,” with real-time Mandarin commentary. (Suplex, in case you were wondering, translates as deshi beishuai, or “German-style back throw.”) PPTV subscriptions start at less than $3 per month, roughly a third of what W.W.E.’s own subscription service costs outside China, and include movies and other shows.
Much rides on Mr. Wang, W.W.E.’s first mainland wrestler. The company’s social media team works to make him a star — his 
 on the Weibo social media service recently featured videos of him training at W.W.E.’s huge facility in Orlando, Fla. Seven other mainlanders, six men and one woman, will relocate to Orlando in January.
Mr. Wang, a 22-year-old native of eastern Anhui Province, was an athlete after middle school, a member of the provincial rowing team. He later moved to Shanghai and took up sparring, and caught the attention of representatives from Inoki Genome Federation, a big Japanese wrestling and 
 promotion.
Mr. Wang spent three years in Japan before he was noticed by W.W.E. He signed a three-year development deal with the American company and started training in Orlando over the summer in preparation for his China debut.
When the moment finally arrived in Shanghai in September, Mr. Wang entered the arena to modern Chinese music. He gave the crowd a traditional Chinese, kung fu-style greeting, pressing his right fist into his left palm.
His opponent, a wrestler named Bo Dallas, was booed by the Shanghai crowd before Mr. Wang tossed him to the mat, 
 on the second try.
Mr. Wang doesn’t yet have a defined act or character, or even a flashy name. One of the oldest such personas in W.W.E.-style wrestling is the foreign heel, or bad guy; those include personas like Mr. Fuji, a Japanese villain played by the late

In an interview, Mr. Wang said he wasn’t a big believer in appealing to such nationalistic tropes.
“People shouldn’t see you for your nationality or ethnic group,” he said. “It’s less about that and more about what you can do, personally, as a warrior and a figure in the ring.”",‘Suplex’ in Chinese?

"BEIJING — China has clarified for the first time a closely watched issue of land rights that has 
 for the millions of Chinese who park their wealth in their homes.
Chinese officials said that a group of homeowners in Wenzhou, an eastern city, would not have to pay a fee to extend the rights to the land under their residences. Homeowners in China own their dwellings but not the land under them. All land in China is owned by the government, which parcels it out to developers and homeowners through 20- to 70-year leases.
In Wenzhou, the local government had told some homeowners whose 20-year leases had expired that they would have to pay a large fee to renew, and the situation was being monitored closely across the country. Many Chinese homeowners, a bedrock of the country’s economy and growing consumer sector, worried that they would have to pay dearly to keep using the land under their homes.
The decision, announced on Friday by Wang Guanghua, China’s vice minister of land and resources, stops short of providing homeowners nationwide a clear legal framework on land ownership rights. Nevertheless, it could pave the way for similar moves in other cities.
At a news conference, Mr. Wang said that the measures were temporary and that the government was working on “relevant legal arrangements” for those holding 70-year leases, according to a transcript of the briefing on the ministry’s website. Much of China’s residential land is covered by 70-year leases.
Land ownership rights became a focus in Wenzhou in April when the local government demanded that homeowners whose land-use rights had expired after 20 years pay fees of up to a third of the value of their homes before they could sell them. The decision provoked protests from property owners in Wenzhou, a coastal city of eight million that was one of the first areas to establish private enterprise after the Chinese government opened the economy in the late 1970s.
Xinhua, the main state news agency, hailed the government’s decision as “one small step for Wenzhou, one giant leap for China.” Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, called it “the biggest news of the year.”
Land-use rights are set to expire in Qingdao, Jinan and Shenzhen, Xinhua said.
The measures “conform to the expectations of the masses,” it said in a commentary on Saturday. “For all citizens, it is transmitting spring’s first glow of warm air.”
The number of residents affected by the 20-year land-use rights in Wenzhou is relatively small. China Youth Daily, a state-run news outlet, said about 600 households had 20-year leases expiring next year and 1,700 others had such leases expiring by 2019. But their property transactions have been in limbo because of the uncertainty over the land-use rights.
“If the authorities simply cannot allow for the use of the land without paying a hefty price, then it will be very hard,” said Dali Yang, who teaches at the University of Chicago and has studied property rights in China. “For many families, it will be a very significant hardship.”
“It will be a huge political liability,” he said. “It will also turn people away, not just against the government, but also against the country, in the sense that some people may decide to throw in the towel and emigrate.”
In 2007, China moved to reassure homeowners by requiring that local governments renew 70-year leases automatically. Yet the law did not make clear whether homeowners would have to pay for the renewal or what would happen to those with shorter leases.
China has one of the highest rates of homeownership in the world, about 90 percent. Many people see it as a good investment in a country that has not had a sustained housing slump. Homeownership also plays a social role: 
 is widely seen as 
.
In the last two decades, since the government has allowed private homeownership, many people have rushed to buy homes without considering the legal issues governing their limited land-use rights.
A majority of them expected the government to grant them full ownership of their homes without repossession or a huge fee to renew their land rights. Those moves could hurt the Chinese property market and anger the middle class, which is an important constituency of the ruling Communist Party and is richer, larger and more aware of its rights than ever before.",China Reassures Homeowners Worried About Land Rights,"DEC. 26, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/26/business/china-wenzhou-land-lease.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,SUI-LEE WEE
"BEIJING — 
 officially resumed diplomatic relations with São Tomé and Príncipe on Monday after that African island nation 
 last week.
The move is a victory for Beijing, which considers the self-governing island of 
 a part of China’s territory and has been outraged by suggestions by President-elect Donald J. Trump that he could rethink American policy that acknowledges this.
Beijing and Taipei have competed for allies for much of the nearly seven decades since the end of China’s civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled across the Taiwan Strait.
The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, and his counterpart from São Tomé, Urbino Botelho, appeared together on Monday at a ceremony in Beijing. Mr. Wang said that re-establishing relations would benefit both countries.
Most of the world does not formally recognize Taiwan, a condition of maintaining relations with China. Twenty-one countries and governments, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean, have official ties with Taiwan.
The Taiwanese foreign minister, David Lee, last week accused São Tomé of demanding “an astronomical amount of financial help,” though he did not say how much.
São Tomé is an island nation off the coast of west-central Africa with a population of almost 200,000. An impoverished former Portuguese colony, it relies heavily on foreign aid. Beijing suspended its relationship with São Tomé in 1997 after the island nation established diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
In a statement, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry expressed its “strong disappointment and regret that São Tomé has been confused by the diplomatic money campaign of mainland China and ignored the years of our great contributions to the health and well-being of the people of São Tomé.”
As its economic, military and political clout has grown, China has become more successful in pulling away governments in a bid to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, though some countries, including the United States, maintain strong unofficial ties with Taipei.
Relations have worsened between Beijing and Taipei since the independence-leaning president of Taiwan, 
, was elected in January.
Wang Dong, a professor of international relations at Peking University, said the re-establishment of diplomatic ties was a warning to Taiwan that Beijing has “a lot of countermeasures” up its sleeve should the island pursue independence, as well as a warning to the United States.
“The U.S. won’t gain anything if they play with the One China policy,” he said. “It is also a warning to those in the U.S. who tolerate and support the Taiwanese independence forces.”","China Resumes Ties With São Tomé, Which Turned Away From Taiwan","DEC. 26, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/26/world/asia/china-taiwan-sao-tome-diplomatic-relations.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
"If President-elect 
 meant what he said, then the world may one day look back to recall that the first superpower nuclear arms race since the Cold War was 
 by two pajama-clad talk show hosts.
“Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,” Mika Brzezinski, of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, said on Friday. She and her co-host, curled up in holiday-themed nightwear in front of a fake fireplace, said the quote was a statement from Mr. Trump, elaborating on a 
 on nuclear weapons.
Mr. Trump has a history of bluster and his declarations may turn out to be bluffs. But should he follow through on instigating a nuclear arms race, the consequences could be severe. Best estimates of likely Russian and Chinese responses offer a concerning guide. So do lessons from the Cold War arms race, which brought the world so close to the brink that once-hostile American and Soviet adversaries worked to reverse the competition they had once seen as essential.
Nuclear arms races are not usually something that states set out to provoke, but are pulled into against their wills.
In the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union saw themselves as reacting to one another, straining to maintain a strategic balance that would deter war or at least make it survivable.
Winston Churchill remarked in 1954 that more warheads could accomplish little more than to “make the rubble bounce.”
But this quote reflects a long-held misunderstanding: that the arms race was a simple matter of accruing warheads.
In fact, it was far more dangerous, with ever-growing stockpiles merely reflecting complex tit-for-tat advances. For instance, one country might develop weapons that could deliver warheads more rapidly, which would require the other to shorten its response time and build redundant, retaliatory weapons.
While “arms race” describes the sets of policies that helped make the Cold War so dangerous, arms racing was not in itself policy. Rather, it was a much-lamented — and much-feared — byproduct of American and Soviet aims. Leaders on both sides wanted to avoid losing, but none saw the race as desirable.
The exception, Ronald Reagan, entered office in 1981 determined to win the Cold War in part by outstripping the Soviet Union on nuclear arms. But after a few years of tightening response times and near-miss incidents, he became the most enthusiastic proponent of nuclear disarmament to occupy the Oval Office.
Though some Americans believe the arms race won the Cold War, as Mr. Reagan had initially hoped, the two sides ended their competition willingly — and a few years before internal political and economic forces would pull down the Soviet Union from within.
Mr. Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought total disarmament at a 1986 summit meeting. Unable to agree on terms, they settled for an ongoing drawdown of nuclear forces, reversing the arms race.
Such reductions have continued since, codified in treaties such as the 2010 New Start agreement, which Mr. Trump’s policy would likely undo.
In his Twitter post on Thursday announcing that policy, Mr. Trump said his goal was that “the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”
It is not clear what that means. But whatever his intention, analysts say that Mr. Trump’s stated desire to provoke an arms race does have a foreseeable range of outcomes.
The two countries most likely to respond are Russia, whose nuclear arsenal is comparable to that of the United States, and China, which has a far smaller program.
Though each has a slightly different goal, both design their programs to counterbalance the United States, and will therefore calibrate to keep pace with any American advances.
But analysts warn that, in part because the United States is already so much more powerful in conventional terms, Russia and China may feel forced to take actions that are destabilizing and put all parties at risk.
Since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has seen nuclear parity with the United States as its last — perhaps only — guarantee of survival against a far stronger Western alliance it perceives as an existential threat. Falling behind would, in Moscow’s view, invite Russia’s destruction.
Though Russia’s economy is a fraction the size of America’s, it has kept up. Should it find parity too costly, Moscow would likely compensate by expending another kind of currency: its willingness to accept nuclear risk.
This would be aimed at strengthening Russian deterrence against any American threat. For instance, Russia might deploy more nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave located between Poland and Lithuania. Such missiles can reach European capitals in a matter of minutes and, because they are fired from special vehicles, can be difficult to knock out.
Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, could also loosen restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons. Some analysts already believe that Russian military doctrine allows for the use of a single “de-escalatory” nuclear strike, in case of a conventional war, to force the other side to stand down. Such policies put a greater onus on the United States to reduce risk, compensating for any relative Russian weakness.
Beijing’s nuclear aims are less ambitious: to retain just enough ability that, should the United States attack first, it can fire a few nuclear weapons in retaliation.
Should Mr. Trump advance American nuclear abilities — even if this is aimed principally at Russia — China will fear that an American first strike could wipe out its warheads. This would render China’s nuclear deterrent effectively obsolete, all but forcing it to compensate.
Vipin Narang, a nuclear weapons expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said China would build up its own abilities, but worried that it would seek a quicker fix as well.
China might preload nuclear warheads onto missiles to shorten its response time, Mr. Narang suggested. Or it could hide missiles in hardened locations, like tunnels. It might consider adopting Pakistan’s practice of putting warheads in unmarked vans and driving them around the country, in a never-ending road trip, to keep them safe from attack.
China could also decide to abandon its policy against the first use of nuclear weapons in any conflict “because they could not afford to go second,” Mr. Narang said.
Mr. Narang emphasized that such steps would increase the risk of an accident or miscalculation that, while remote, could be catastrophic.
Of Mr. Trump’s intentions and their likely impact in Beijing and Moscow, Mr. Narang said, “It’s a scary new world if he’s serious about, and trying to trigger, an arms race with either or both.”
Paul C. Warnke, a senior Pentagon official in the Cold War’s early years, concluded that their mutual buildups were less like a race than two runners on adjacent treadmills. “The only victory the arms race has to offer,” he wrote in 1975, was to “be first off the treadmill.”
Mr. Warnke’s view was controversial at the time, but later became accepted even by many dedicated Cold Warriors. The early 1980s had seen near misses that had brought the world intolerably close to the edge.
In 1983, for instance, a Soviet early-warning system detected an incoming American nuclear attack. It happened to be a moment of high tension in which the Kremlin had feared a pre-emptive strike.
Because of missile advances that had come as part of the arms race, the Soviets had only 23 minutes to respond before the missiles would land — not enough time to double-check equipment, much less negotiate with Washington. The arms race also dictated that the Soviet Union respond with overwhelming retaliation against the United States, to quickly neutralize any further threat.
The Soviet officer in charge of the early-warning station could see no evidence of a false alarm, but told his superiors that it was. His guess, proved correct, may have saved the world.
Though the episode would not become public for years, Mr. Reagan wrote in his memoirs that another war scare, which occurred that same month when Soviet forces shot down a South Korean airliner that had wandered into Soviet airspace, “demonstrated how close the world had come to the precipice and how much we needed nuclear arms control.”
Mr. Reagan principally turned against the arms race because of its dangers, but others came to oppose it for the simple reason that, after decades and billions or perhaps trillions of dollars, it had failed to accomplish victory.
“Building nukes to get others to stop historically has had the same effect as telling everyone in an email storm to cease using ‘Reply All,’ ” Joshua H. Pollack, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, joked on Twitter.
Mr. Pollack added, “There is no last, winning move when it comes to arms racing.”

"BEIJING — He is known in 
 as the “godfather of real estate,” helping lay the groundwork for private homeownership in China, a move that enriched millions and laid the foundations for a vibrant and thriving Chinese middle class.
Now, Meng Xiaosu wants a lot of Chinese — the older ones, specifically — to cash out.
Older people need to mortgage their homes to address China’s looming demographic bust, Mr. Meng argues. Because of China’s 
 and other social trends, the country has a rapidly graying population that someday soon may become too expensive for the Chinese government to support.
Mr. Meng's proposed solution is to bring reverse mortgages to China. Called a house-for-pension plan in China, a reverse mortgage allows homeowners to tap the equity in their homes by taking out loans against it.
His argument faces deep business and cultural opposition — mortgaging homes is a tough sell in a country where parents traditionally passed them on to their children — and only a few dozen people in all the country have signed up so far. But he argues that China may have little choice.
“China’s elderly do not have much money,” said Mr. Meng, who drew much of his inspiration about the Chinese property market from a stint studying in America, “but they have valuable homes.”
China is increasingly pondering tough questions as it looks to a graying future. Right now, China’s 215 million elderly people account for 15 percent of the total population. By 2050, that number is expected to rise to 350 million — nearly one-quarter of the population.
That has China scrambling to find a more sustainable pension system for its people. In the 1990s, the government dismantled the cradle-to-grave welfare system and borrowed money from younger workers to pay older ones. The country’s pension fund will be $116 trillion in the red by 2050, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank.
Enter Mr. Meng.
The apparatchik turned businessman, who now runs a Chinese 
 firm, argues that it is not practical for retirees to live on slow-growing pension benefits while home prices have soared over the past two decades.
“Under these circumstances, participating in the house-for-pension plan can be regarded as an important option for China’s elderly to improve their living conditions and live better in their later years,” he said.
“If the elderly in China had a lot of insurance or a high savings rate like in Japan, then they don’t have to participate in the house-for-pension plan,” Mr. Meng added. “But they don’t have either.”
Reverse mortgages 
 
 in 
, too. But in China they defy traditional attitudes about family.
Yu Yue, a 61-year-old widow and former factory worker in Beijing, is considering the plan. She scrapes by on $434 a month in pension payments, and her son gives her the same amount monthly.
“I would like to give my apartment to my child,” Ms. Yu said. “But I’m helpless. I need some form of safety net.”
Insurance companies say they were worried about the prospect of a real estate crash as well as longer life expectancy in China. China also lacks the fundamental legal framework to govern the program, said Hu Jiye, a professor who studies pension finance at the China University of Political Science and Law.
“Mr. Meng Xiaosu is the proponent of the house-for-pension plan, and as such, he’s willing to go ahead with it even if it’s a money-losing venture,” he said. “But the cultural environment doesn’t support it. Neither does the legal environment.”
Mr. Meng dismissed concerns about legal issues. Regarding insurance industry worries about a housing slump, he said, “I told them: ‘Stop asking me this brainless question. It doesn’t exist. It has never fallen even in a year. How can it be a bubble?’”
Mr. Meng helped create the program, which is offered in Beijing, Shanghai and two other Chinese cities. As of the end of October, only 89 people had participated, according to Happy Life Insurance, an insurer founded by Mr. Meng in part to offer the policy — and, currently, only one of two insurers offering it.
But the Chinese government said in July that it would extend the pilot plan to dozens of cities — Mr. Meng estimated 60 — over the next two years, and the People’s Insurance Company (Group) of China, a major insurer, said it had started offering the plan in October.
Mr. Meng, 67, never graduated from high school, coming of age amid the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, and became a Red Guard, writing up posters denouncing people who were deemed political enemies. “I never beat anyone,” he said.
In 1978, he enrolled in the prestigious Peking University, among the first group of students who passed the first higher education entrance exams held after the Cultural Revolution. He was 28. Premier Li Keqiang was his classmate.
Mr. Meng eventually became the aide to Wan Li, the former vice premier of China and the pioneer of agricultural reforms.
He went on to become president of the China National Real Estate Development Group Corporation, the country’s largest state-owned property developer, formulating many policies that earned him the title of “godfather of real estate.”
In Mr. Meng’s office are dozens of framed photographs of him with other senior Chinese politicians as well as Bill Clinton, whom he calls a “close friend.” (“At first, I thought about sending Hillary a note but didn’t,” he said the day after the presidential election. “In the end I thought, since a real estate magnate is president, we will have a bigger say. Will the U.S. real estate mogul turned president be willing to speak with China’s godfather of real estate?”)
In 1995, Mr. Meng traveled to the United States as a visiting scholar to study economics and real estate for six months at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the University of California, Berkeley; and Indiana University. That experience had a profound impact on Mr. Meng — and ultimately, China’s middle class. It led him to believe that the Chinese people could have their version of the American dream — “one house, one car,” as he put it.
Once home, he persuaded skeptical banks that Chinese people would pay back their mortgages. That helped introduce a housing market in which prices are controlled by the market, not the government, leading to the price appreciation that has enriched millions of Chinese households.
“All these products that I introduced were from abroad, especially from the United States,” he said.
As home prices in China soared, Mr. Meng began studying the reverse mortgage systems in countries such as the Netherlands and the United States. In 2003, he wrote a letter to his former colleague Wen Jiabao, who had just become premier of China, telling him that Chinese retirees “will be able to live comfortably” with the house-for-pension plan.
That year, Beijing approved the pilot program, stoking widespread controversy. Several people blamed the government for shirking its responsibility in providing for their old age. Under the plan, if the borrower’s children are not willing to buy the property, it will be sold in an auction. The insurance company would deduct the capital and interest payments, and any leftover money would be given to the borrower’s children.
Mr. Meng said he would join the plan when he formally retired. His 31-year-old son approves of it, according to Mr. Meng. “I’m in no rush now,” he said. “When I enroll, I want to create an impact and make the elderly feel at ease.”",China’s ‘Godfather of Real Estate’ Pitches Reverse Mortgages to Skeptical Elders,"DEC. 26, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/26/business/reverse-mortgages-chinese-real-estate.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,SUI-LEE WEE
"BEIJING — In a sign of growing cultural ties between mainland 
 and 
, officials in Hong Kong have announced plans to build a museum to serve as a permanent display space for objects from Beijing’s 
, home to some of China’s most treasured imperial artifacts.
Under the agreement, which was signed in Beijing on Friday by 
, Hong Kong’s second-ranking official, and 
, director of the Palace Museum, what is being called the Hong Kong Palace Museum will be built as part of the 
, a colossal government-backed cultural infrastructure project.
The museum, costing $451 million and scheduled to be completed in 2022, will be managed by a subsidiary of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. Artifacts from the Palace Museum collection highlighting imperial life and culture in China will be exhibited on a long-term basis.
The Hong Kong architect 
 has been tapped to design the building, which will have an estimated 328,000 square feet of floor space and feature two exhibition galleries, activity rooms, a 400-seat lecture theater, a gift shop and a restaurant. Costs for the project are being fully covered by a donation from the 
, a nonprofit organization that has supported several Palace Museum exhibitions in Hong Kong in the past.
Government officials are describing the project as part of larger celebrations planned for next year to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s transfer in 1997 from British colonial rule to China.
“This is the best and greatest gift to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to the motherland,” Leung Chun-ying, Hong Kong’s leader, said at the 
.
For many in Hong Kong, the announcement on Friday came as a surprise, prompting critics to raise concerns about the lack of transparency in the government’s decision-making process.
On Monday, Ms. Lam dismissed the concerns, asserting that the preparation and approval of the new museum had been carried out “in accordance with procedures.”
“Since the plan for the entire West Kowloon Cultural District was designated for art and cultural facilities, it was not necessary to hold another public consultation on city planning just to build a new museum,” she said, according to 
 published on the Hong Kong government’s news website.
Ms. Lam’s remarks appear to have done little to assuage her critics, many of whom have long been wary of efforts by Beijing to assert its influence in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory. At times, the central government in Beijing has acted brazenly, as seen recently when China 
 in a local court case, essentially blocking two pro-independence politicians from taking seats in Hong Kong’s legislature.
But more often than not, critics say, Beijing’s influence in the city is felt indirectly. Last year, for example, officials at 
+, Hong Kong’s planned museum of contemporary visual culture and another focal point of the West Kowloon Cultural District development, 
 that the museum’s government financing would make it vulnerable to unseen political pressures packaged as bureaucratic procedures.
With the new Hong Kong Palace Museum, however, there will be no denying Beijing’s presence. The original Palace Museum, which was founded in 1925 in the heart of China’s capital, is, along with the Great Wall, one of China’s most prominent landmarks.
In 2014, more than 15 million people visited the Palace Museum, which is housed within the Forbidden City, though it probably is remembered more for its vermilion walls, white marble footbridges and yellow-glazed roof tiles than for its collection of artifacts, which are typically displayed in the wings of the sprawling complex.
The Palace Museum’s collection comprises vast holdings of more than 1.8 million artifacts built on the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties and later expanded during the 20th century. In the 1940s, however, a number of the most prized objects were carried off by Chiang Kai-shek’s retreating Nationalist forces to Taiwan, where they are now displayed in Taiwan’s own 
.
Still, the Beijing Palace Museum’s collection is by all accounts impressive, and it includes important works of bronzeware, jade, sculptures, seals, ceramics, calligraphy and paintings such as the famous 12th-century scroll “Along the River During the Qingming Festival,” which drew large crowds in 2007 when it made a 
 at the Hong Kong Museum of Art.
Given the success of previous exhibits, many in China and Hong Kong have applauded the decision to build a Hong Kong outpost as an opportunity to showcase more of the Palace Museum’s holdings before a wider audience. Because of limited space, Beijing’s Palace Museum displays only 0.5 percent of its collection in any given year, Mr. Shan, the museum’s director, said 
 in October.
At that conference, Mr. Shan also announced plans to build a new 1.3 million-square-foot branch of the Palace Museum in northern Beijing so that more cultural relics could be displayed to the public. And, this week, the Palace Museum is scheduled to unveil a 140,000-square foot “

"SEOUL, South Korea — A senior North Korean official who defected to the South told reporters on Tuesday that the North viewed 2017 as the best time to advance its nuclear program because it could take advantage of leadership changes in the United States and 
.
The official, Thae Yong-ho, 
’s No. 2 diplomat in London, is the most senior North Korean official to defect in nearly two decades. At a news conference with South Korean reporters — his first meeting with outside journalists 
 — he cautioned that as a diplomat, he was not privy to the status of North Korea’s 
 program.
Yet he said North Korea was also confident that 
 would not punish it too harshly for its nuclear program, out of fear that the North’s collapse would create a pro-American, unified Korea on its border.
“North Korea knows this weakness of China,” Mr. Thae said. “As long as 
 is in power, North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons, even if it’s offered $1 trillion or $10 trillion in rewards.”
The foreign news media was not allowed into Mr. Thae’s 150-minute news conference in Seoul with local reporters. But a transcript revealed Mr. Thae’s thoughts on his home country and its leader, Mr. Kim.
He said Mr. Kim did not consider his nuclear weapons program a bargaining chip but rather sought to deal with the United States after being recognized as a nuclear power, a status Washington has pledged not to grant.
This year, North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles, and it has openly vowed to develop the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead.
President-elect 
 that he was open to allowing Japan and South Korea to manufacture their own nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, an idea that drew a withering response from the Obama administration, which said the idea flouted decades of nonproliferation policy.
South Korea will hold a presidential election next year.
Mr. Thae, a career diplomat, served in Denmark and Sweden before he was assigned to the North Korean Embassy in London about 10 years ago. In London, he was spotted delivering speeches at far-left events, including meetings of the British Communist Party, where he would speak passionately in defense of North Korea.
On Tuesday, he spoke of frustration as a North Korean diplomat abroad.
He said that North Korea paid its ambassadors only $900 to $1,100 a month, making its diplomats desperate for an extra income through work outside the embassy. The diplomats live a communal life inside their embassy to save costs, he added.
But he said they enjoyed one luxury the elites back in the North could not: They had access to the internet and could read news from South Korea, including updates about the lives of North Korean defectors.
Mr. Thae said that back in the North, the totalitarian regime was so paranoid about outside information affecting its people that it kept surveillance on diplomats who had returned home for fear they might spread outside news, even though DVDs smuggled in from China have made South Korean movies and soap operas increasingly popular in the North.
Mr. Thae himself was an avid fan of South Korean soap operas.
South Korea has hailed his defection as a sign of loosening loyalty among the North Korean elite. The North called him “human scum” and said he had fled after embezzling state funds and sexually assaulting a minor.
Mr. Thae denied these accusations on Tuesday and said his disillusionment with Mr. Kim had deepened after 
, including the leader’s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in an attempt to tighten his control through a reign of terror.
The North Korean government requires its diplomats to leave some of their family members back home, holding them as hostages against potential defections. Mr. Thae said he was lucky because he could defect to the South with his wife and two children.
North Korean diplomats are also required to monitor one another to thwart treason. But Mr. Thae said there were holes in the surveillance, although he declined to divulge details of how he had defected.

"TOKYO — Since becoming prime minister for the second time in 2012, 
 has made it a centerpiece of his foreign policy to steer 
 closer to the United States.
Even as Washington has lost ground in the region, with 
 expanding its presence in the South China Sea and North Korea defying efforts to restrain its nuclear development, Mr. Abe has stood by the Obama administration, holding it close.
Yet as Mr. Abe 
 on Tuesday with 
, in a symbolic capstone to the relationship between the two leaders, that approach may be tested more than ever.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multinational trade deal that both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama championed, is in tatters now that President-elect 
 
. North Korea appears to be on the verge of a nuclear breakthrough. China has lately been more aggressive in both the East and South China Seas.
And Mr. Trump brings other kinds of uncertainty, grumbling about Japanese trade barriers and the cost of United States military support, and raising the specter of a more confrontational approach to China that could have unpredictable results in the region.
“Japan is in a kind of a crisis over what direction we can go,” said Kyoji Fukao, a professor of international economics at Hitotsubashi University.
The alliance between Japan and the United States has endured since the end of 
, but analysts say Mr. Abe, a conservative nationalist, and Mr. Obama, a liberal who had ambitions to change the world, have helped to make the partnership stronger than it has been for decades.
“This is the strongest, most reliable and trusting relationship probably in the last 40 years at least,” said Takatoshi Ito, a professor of international finance and trade at Columbia University. “This has been a good four years.”
Given Mr. Abe’s nationalist leanings, he might not have seemed the most likely Japanese leader to embrace the United States, or a Democrat like Mr. Obama, so warmly.
Yet since he took office four years ago, after an earlier stint as prime minister in 2006-7, Mr. Abe has committed Japan to several policies favored by the Obama administration.
Mr. Abe expanded Japan’s support of United States military bases despite fierce opposition in Okinawa, and pushed through controversial security legislation that allows Japan’s military, the Self Defense Forces, to 
. He offered nonmilitary aid to countries battling the Islamic State, even as 
.
The clearest motivation for Mr. Abe was the need for a partner in defending against a rising China.
“In the regional geopolitics, I think Japan and the U.S. are both pushed closer to each other by China,” Mr. Ito said. “For security, there is no one but the U.S. which can provide the security to Japan, so there is no question about it.”
Mr. Obama provided very clear promises of protection. In 2014, during a visit to Tokyo, he declared that a security treaty 
 in its confrontation with China over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. It was the first time an American president had explicitly said so.
Now Japan’s leaders are warily watching Mr. Trump’s approach to China. They may like that Mr. Trump is taking a more aggressive stance toward Beijing on issues like trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea, but there are also risks for Japan if that stance triggers a hostile response.
“Standing tall vis-à-vis Beijing is of course welcome,” said Sheila A. Smith, a Japan expert at the 
. But “the potential for use of force or a much more bellicose U.S.-Chinese relationship would be an uncomfortable spot for Tokyo.”
Partly in hopes of providing another counterweight to China, Mr. Abe has worked for months to develop a relationship with Russia, trying to 
 over a set of islands that has prevented the signing of a peace treaty since World War II ended. But a recent summit meeting in Japan between Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and Mr. Abe ended with little progress.
Perhaps an even bigger disappointment for Mr. Abe is Mr. Trump’s vow to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, on which both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama spent considerable political capital.
For Mr. Abe, it was in part an excuse to push for changes in Japan’s agricultural industry, as well as an opportunity to gain tariff-free access for Japanese manufacturers to export markets in the United States and elsewhere. Now his only hope is to try to persuade Mr. Trump to resuscitate the deal. Mr. Abe briefly met Mr. Trump in New York in November, and he hopes to see Mr. Trump again in Washington shortly after the inauguration.
Mr. Abe has said he will continue to push for trade deals with other countries, and he is also seeking international partners on other issues. He visited Cuba and 
, asking for Mr. Castro’s help in reining in North Korea’s nuclear program. In October, Japan and Britain conducted their 
 as part of a move to establish closer security ties in the East and South China Seas.
But the alliance with the United States remains the bedrock of Japan’s security, and none of its leaders are currently considering any other significant alternative. Given that, Mr. Abe and other Japanese officials will work hard to persuade Mr. Trump to maintain a strong partnership.
Some analysts said that may be a matter of education as much as anything else. “We are not sure that he knows the concrete measures or details of U.S.-Japan security relations,” said Fumiaki Kubo, a professor of political science at the University of Tokyo, speaking of Mr. Trump.
“What Prime Minister Abe has to do is give him Lesson 101 on U.S.-Japan relations,” Mr. Kubo said.","Without Obama, Shinzo Abe’s Approach to U.S.-Japan Ties May Be Tested","DEC. 27, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/world/asia/shinzo-abe-barack-obama-alliance.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MOTOKO RICH
"Law firms that advise on mergers once had to worry about a rogue employee trading on deal tips. Now, they have to worry about hackers doing the same.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan 
 with making more than $4 million by trading on information they got by hacking into some of the top merger-advising law firms in New York. The three men targeted at least seven New York law firms to try to obtain information about deals in the works, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday.
The men were successful in hacking two firms, stealing emails of partners who work on mergers, prosecutors said. The three then bought shares of target companies, selling them after the deals were announced, prosecutors said.
Shares of targets in most such transactions tend to trade higher when a deal is announced because they are usually purchased for more than their market price.
Hackers’ ability to breach the defenses of big law firms in search of confidential information about corporate clients — including tips about coming mergers and acquisitions — has long been a concern of federal authorities. Most major law firms have played down the threat posed by hackers and have been reluctant to discuss breaches or even attempted breaches.
“This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,” 
, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. “You are and will be targets of cyberhacking because you have information valuable to would-be criminals.”
The law firms were not identified in the indictment or in a parallel civil complaint brought by the 
.
Earlier this year, one large New York firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, confirmed that it had been the victim of a “limited breach” of its computer network in the summer of 2015. At the time, the law firm said it was “not aware that any of the information that may have been accessed has been used improperly.”
Cravath did not immediately respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment on Tuesday.
“Law firms have been identified as the weakest link, and it is great to see the U.S. attorney taking an interest,” said Daniel Garrie, a law firm security consultant.
The three men charged with insider trading and hacking are Iat Hong, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, the United States attorney’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Mr. Hong, a resident of Macau, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas.
The indictment and the S.E.C. complaint detailed a number of major deals in which confidential information had been retrieved.
One law firm was hacked in connection with the sale of Intermune, an American drug maker, to Roche of Switzerland, and the sale of Altera, a circuit manufacturer, to Intel. In both cases, the three men entered the law firm’s servers after unlawfully obtaining an employee’s credentials. They then installed malware on the law firm’s web server, prosecutors said, enabling them to obtain information about live deals, including the price at which they were being negotiated.
The three successfully penetrated the servers of another law firm to obtain details about the acquisition by Pitney Bowes of Borderfree, prosecutors said.
They were extraordinarily active in pursuing information. The indictment says that from March to September 2015, the three men “attempted to cause unauthorized access to the networks and servers of the targeted law firms on more than 100,000 occasions.”
Lawyers for the three men could not immediately be located.
The three were also involved with a start-up robotics company that was developing controller chips and control system solutions. They were accused of having sought confidential information like proprietary designs from two other robotics companies.","3 Men Made Millions by Hacking Merger Lawyers, U.S. Says","DEC. 27, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/business/dealbook/new-york-hacking-law-firms-insider-trading.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,LESLIE PICKER
"At Saks Off Fifth recently, an Ivanka Trump white polyester and spandex blouse made in Indonesia was marked down to $34.99, from $69. A few racks over, her black and white jacket came from Vietnam, while several blocks away, at Macy’s, her leather bootee manufactured in China sold for more than $100.
At the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, a $35 blue cotton cap embroidered with “Trump National Golf Club” was made in Bangladesh. A Trump Tower hoodie from Pakistan set tourists back $50.
A majority of clothes these days are made anywhere but in America. And in this era of local pride and nationalistic fervor, that has become a political liability.

, threatening to punish companies with high tariffs if they don’t move production to the United States.
Should Mr. Trump make good on such promises, he would take aim at not only his own brand, but his daughter’s as well.
Mr. Trump doesn’t stand to lose much. While his goods are largely manufactured overseas, most of his retail ventures have gone the way of Trump vodka and steaks. And what products can be found — at his hotels and golf courses and on Amazon sold by independent sellers — are the vestiges of a mostly defunct clothing line or sporadic shipments of Trump sweatshirts and hats.
, by contrast, is the type of operation that Mr. Trump is squarely aiming for. Her shoes and dresses largely retail for less than $150. Coats cost as much as $400.
Factored into those prices is the cost of materials and production, as well as shipping, tariffs, marketing and advertising expenses. Cheap production overseas means more coin in the coffers of Ms. Trump and the shoe, accessory and clothing makers that are her partners, among them Marc Fisher footwear, the G-III Apparel Group and Mondani. (Ms. Trump’s company, which is privately held, does not disclose its financials.)
Almost all of her goods are made overseas, according to a New York Times review of shipments compiled separately by Panjiva and 
, two trade databases. ImportGenius tallied 193 shipments for imported goods associated with Ms. Trump for the year through Dec. 5, mostly Chinese-made shoes and handbags. Her dresses and blouses are made in China, Indonesia and Vietnam, according to a review of hundreds of clothing tags and financial documents filed by G-III.
It is the harsh reality of the clothing business.
Before Ms. Trump started her shoe and clothing lines in the early 2010s, she did what any well-connected New Yorker would, consulting corporate chieftains, fashion designers and department store executives. She ultimately decided to license her name.
Since then, Ms. Trump, 35, has pondered making some items in-house. Investors were consulted, and a business plan was drawn up — but the project was scrapped, said one person briefed on the discussions. It was costly and impractical, so suppliers continued to make her clothes overseas.
“When I started my business, I recognized where my strengths were and knew that I didn’t have any experience in production and manufacturing,” Ms. Trump said in a rare interview.“I am not a designer. I am an entrepreneur.”
In retail, where margins are slim, overseas manufacturers are crucial to profits. Most of the clothing Americans buy at Walmart, Macy’s and Target are made abroad, including 97 
 and 98 percent of shoes, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.
It is part of a long history of American garment manufacturers chasing cheap labor. They moved to China in the 1980s, then elsewhere in Asia. Now, Chinese shoemakers are building factories in Africa, where wages are about $40 a month, compared with $400 in China.
Even then, an overseas strategy does not portend survival, as Mr. Trump’s experience shows.
At Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, the Trump Store is downstairs from the lobby, sandwiched between a restaurant and an ice cream parlor. While a $65 white polo golf shirt from Lesotho in southern Africa was available, there was no sign of many of Mr. Trump’s other items, like the dress shirt made in Vietnam on display upstairs.
Last year, Macy’s dropped Mr. Trump’s clothing line over inflammatory comments he made about Mexican immigrants. Now about the best place to find his ties, dress shirts and accessories is on Amazon.com — and even that stock is just a hodgepodge.
The company that made Trump-branded comforters and sheets, Downlite, said it had ended its relationship with him last year. His beds, designed by Dorya, aren’t in stores, either. They are made to order overseas, according to the company.
Mr. Trump said in campaign interviews that he would like to make his apparel in the United States, but that it was hard to find companies that did. When George Stephanopoulos of ABC pressed him to explain, Mr. Trump said, “They don’t even make the stuff here.”
That is not exactly true.
B J Nickol, president of the All American Clothing Company, based in Arcanum, Ohio, said he employed 15 people, as well as subcontractors in about 20 states who cut, sew and ship shirts, jeans and sweaters. He estimated it cost All American $10 to $15 to manufacture a polo shirt, including fabric and labor. He sells them for about $28 to $38, or about half of what a polo shirt costs at Trump Tower.
While the company mostly sells shirts to individuals, Mr. Nickol said he would welcome a big-time customer like Mr. Trump. Mr. Nickol said he had witnessed the impact on his community when apparel manufacturers moved away. “And the only way we could think of to fix that was to keep jobs here,” he said.
While large-scale clothing manufacturing is unlikely to return to the United States, specialty items or high-end apparel has promise. 
 a fashion designer who makes sleek separates and sells them online, sews his clothes at a factory in East Rutherford, N.J.
But there are trade-offs, namely price. A pair of women’s jeans made by Todd Shelton costs $200; an Oxford shirt is $180.
And cost is only one factor. Fashion is another.
Recently, Ms. Trump tried to make a flip-flop in the United States. She and one of her main partners, Marc Fisher, shopped a design to retailers, according to a person with knowledge of the venture. Buyers, though, didn’t like the design — and it never got made.
With the Ivanka Trump brand, another variable now comes into play: politics.
Ms. Trump served as a more polished emissary of her father’s messages during the campaign, and she is under pressure to bring jobs home. And in a postelection era, her carefully crafted public persona, which is at the heart of the brand, is at risk.
Ms. Trump has found a way to commercialize female empowerment, selling petal pink sheaths and trendy shoes to young professionals on the go. Her brand’s hashtag #womenwhowork often accompanies pitches to buy her satchels and clothes.
“She wants to make sure her reputation is unblemished,” said Marshal Cohen, a consumer behavior and retail analyst at the NPD Group, a research firm.
Ms. Trump is already facing some blowback.
She was 
 with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan while completing a licensing deal with a company whose largest shareholder is wholly owned by the Japanese government. Consumers offended by her father’s inflammatory comments about minorities continue to boycott her line.
Ms. Trump acknowledged the potential appearance of conflicts as her father prepared to move into the White House. She said she would step down as the head of her namesake brand 
 to her father and the Trump administration.
“I would completely separate myself from my businesses,” said Ms. Trump, who is also considering a 
 from the Trump Organization, where she serves as an executive vice president for development and acquisitions. Representatives for Mr. Trump declined to comment.
But it will not drastically change her company’s strategy. She and her team do not plan to move manufacturing back just to quell critics.
“It’s great to say we want to do all of this, but we want to make responsible business decisions, too,” said Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand. “From a business perspective, we have to have longevity.”","For the Trumps, ‘Made in U.S.A.’ May Be a Tricky Label to Stitch","DEC. 28, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/business/donald-trump-ivanka-clothes-global-trade-overseas-manufacturing.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,LAURA M.

"BEIJING — The Chinese military, in a move analysts described as a challenge to President-elect 
’s strident criticism of 
, has 
 to patrol the contested 
, officials said on Tuesday.
The ship, which is known as 
 and is China’s first and only aircraft carrier, was spotted leading five other Chinese warships this week in patrols near the coasts of Taiwan and Japan. China claims the South China Sea as its own despite objections from neighboring countries and the United States.
Chinese military experts called the deployment of the Liaoning a long-overdue challenge to American military dominance in the Pacific. Several said the move appeared aimed at testing Mr. Trump, who has antagonized Beijing with acerbic words and actions on issues like Taiwan, trade and North Korea.
“The message is: ‘If you test our bottom line, we’ll play that game too,’” said Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.
The decision by Beijing to deploy the carrier group seemed likely to complicate an increasingly fractious relationship between China and the United States.
Nowhere are those tensions more on display than in the South China Sea, where American forces have resisted 
 and military outposts as part of its efforts to assert greater control over the sea, a major commercial waterway.
In the weeks since Mr. Trump’s election, Beijing has increased pressure on the United States, placing weapons on disputed islands and seizing an underwater United States Navy drone from international waters.
Chinese officials appear to be emboldened by Mr. Trump’s pledge to focus on domestic issues and his ambivalence toward 
, an understanding between the United States and China that has underpinned relations for decades.
“The mission is to signal to neighbors that Beijing will set the security table in East Asian waters, and that not even President Donald Trump can reverse that trend,” Patrick M. Cronin, a senior director at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank, said in an email.
Chinese officials played down the significance of the Liaoning’s journey, saying the ships were taking part in annual training exercises.
“The Liaoning aircraft carrier is entitled to the freedom of navigation and overflight under international law,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news conference on Monday. “We hope that all parties will respect this.”
Officials in Taiwan and Japan said that the warships were spotted patrolling their coasts over the past several days. Taiwanese officials said the Liaoning came within 90 nautical miles of the southern tip of the island before entering the South China Sea. Japanese officials said the ships were seen near the shores of Okinawa, in the Pacific Ocean.
Many people in China cheered the deployment of the Liaoning, a discarded vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and refurbished by the Chinese Navy.
While the Liaoning lacks the capabilities of its American counterparts, it is a symbol of national pride for the government, which is in the midst of an effort to vastly upgrade its military capacity to meet its ambition of projecting strength far from Beijing. Officials have announced plans for a second aircraft carrier and other high-tech weapons.
Some commentators in China seized the moment to call on officials to send the Liaoning closer to American shores.
“Aircraft carriers are strategic tools which should be used to show China’s strength to the world and shape the outside world’s attitude toward China,” an editorial in Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often adopts a nationalistic tone, said on Sunday. “As China’s only aircraft carrier fleet now, it should have the ability and courage to sail further.”
The Department of Defense declined to directly address China’s movements in the South China Sea.
“We continue to observe a range of ongoing Chinese military activity in the region,” Cmdr. Gary Ross, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement on Tuesday. “The United States recognizes the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all countries in accordance with international law.”
In Taiwan, officials called for caution. Many residents worry that China is seeking to punish Taiwan for Mr. Trump’s actions. He surprised officials in Beijing when he took a call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, breaking from decades of diplomatic practice. More recently, he 
 the One China principle, prompting sharp rebukes from Beijing.
In 
, Taiwan’s defense minister, Feng Shih-kuan, spoke about the dangers facing the island and urged more training for Taiwanese soldiers. “The threat of our enemies is growing day by day,” he said, according to Reuters.
As China looks to expand its power in the South China Sea, some experts argue that it risks antagonizing nearby countries, potentially pushing them to form stronger alliances with the United States.
“As China’s military power grows, the fear is that so, too, will its appetite for regional hegemony,” said Mr. Cronin of the Center for a New American Security. “Thus China’s coercion will impose yet new costs on Beijing.”
Still, others note China’s ability to win allies in the region through its economic might, and they point to the shifting allegiances of countries like the Philippines, an American ally that has 
 in recent months.
Xu Guangyu, a retired major general in the People’s Liberation Army, said China’s decision to deploy aircraft carriers in faraway waters and to expand its military were natural developments for a country of China’s stature.

"HONG KONG — It has been a tough year in China for America’s technology companies.
 there. Beijing ordered some of 
. And Microsoft faced 
.
Now, in the final days of 2016, China’s internet regulator suggested the coming year may be even trickier. A report by the regulator on Tuesday suggested it would formalize a cybersecurity review system on tech products in the country.
That could mean another problematic step for foreign tech firms in what has already become a tough market. The report did not offer details about what the government checks would look for, but the language was similar to that described 
 about foreign companies quietly submitting to security checks targeting encryption and data storage.
Over the course of 2016 and part of 2015, a number of major foreign technology companies were subject to secretive Chinese security reviews. During the checks, Chinese officials would ask employees of the companies to answer questions about products in person. The reviews are run by a committee of engineers and experts with ties to the country’s military and security agencies.
The checks have already raised alarms among American tech companies, and if formalized, they could create a new standoff between China and the United States over internet policy.
The report, the first of its kind released by the regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, is part of a broader effort to streamline cybersecurity management in the country. More broadly, it outlined other details of efforts to enhance already unprecedented internet controls in China. For example, the report also doubles down on a 
 that raised concerns among human rights groups and foreign companies.
Beijing has struggled to balance its goal of fostering innovation with its desire to keep control over a communication medium it believes could be destabilizing. While it includes boilerplate references to opening up, the report makes clear that the government will continue to err on the side of control for now.
In a section subtitled “Peace,” the report said that Beijing would work to get ahead of a global cybersecurity arms race threatening international peace. In another part, the regulator said that China would use military means if necessary to protect its internet sovereignty. China has said in the past that the internet represents a new realm, akin to space, in which it 
.
The new report is the clearest signal yet of the government’s intent to crystallize those checks into a formal policy.
The document includes a long list of economic sectors that could be deemed sensitive, which could mean that they would eventually be required to use only computing equipment approved by regulators. The sectors include energy, finance, traffic, education, research, industry, water management, manufacturing and health care, as well as communications systems and the internet.
To some degree, bringing the checks into the open would be welcome. Some people who were aware of the security checks on encryption and data storage complained that they were vaguely defined and treated as a secret. For foreign companies, that left open the possibility that the checks could be used to extract trade secrets or to find weaknesses in products for state hackers.
Still, if China were to be more public about the checks, it could lead to copycat policies from other countries, analysts have said.
Drafts of proposed Chinese laws are typically released to domestic and foreign companies for comment. In this case, the reviews were carried out without formal legislative process, meaning that companies had little room to push back.",China’s Cybersecurity Efforts Could Pose New Challenge for Foreign Firms,"DEC. 27, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/business/china-technology-security-review.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PAUL MOZUR
"HONG KONG — Long celebrated as 
’s largest freshwater lake, Poyang reaches more than three times the expanse of Los Angeles in the summer wet season. It is home to the rare Yangtze finless porpoise, and its mud flats are the primary winter feeding grounds for thousands of birds that fly south each autumn to escape Siberia’s chill, including the critically endangered Siberian crane.
Now it is Poyang itself that is at risk.
In recent years, the average expanse of the lake, in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, 
, and winter water levels have declined sharply.
The local government has a proposed solution, but it faces a chorus of opposition from scientists and environmental groups in China and beyond who argue that it could have disastrous effects on the lake’s fragile ecosystem and drive the Siberian crane and other migratory birds further toward extinction.
Water levels in the lake have always fluctuated radically between the summer rains and winter dryness, but there is now concern that the levels are off balance. Culprits include the Three Gorges Dam, which stores water upstream on the Yangtze for winter electricity generation, lowering a nearby river channel and sucking water from the lake. Dredging to collect sand for construction projects has also lowered the lake’s bed and caused more runoff. This year, drought turned much of the lake into grassy plains.
The local government has proposed building a sluice gate to keep more water inside the lake in the winter, but critics say the gate would essentially be a dam, and it could cause bigger problems.
“I think you’re proposing a solution without understanding the causes of the problem,” said David Shankman, a professor emeritus of geography at the University of Alabama who has studied the lake’s hydrology.
“The whole idea of the dam is that there would be some economic benefit, but there may be potential long-term ecological problems,” he added.
The primary feature of the $1.9 billion Poyang Lake Water Conservancy Project would be a 10,000-foot sluice gate across a natural channel that connects the lake’s northern edge to the Yangtze, according to a 
 by the Jiangxi provincial government.
Among other benefits, the report said, the sluice gate would help to stabilize the drinking water supply and promote shipping on the lake. The report described the project as an ideal way to create “first-class water quality, first-class air, first-class ecology and a first-class environmental standard for residents.”
The 
, the government agency that helps oversee economic planning, has been reviewing the proposal since 2009, and the 
 began its environmental impact assessment in November. The proposal could still be derailed if senior officials turn against it.
Scientists said in interviews that the project could irreparably alter the lake’s seasonal flood pulse, which causes water to rise and fall by up to 30 feet between the wet and dry seasons and has carried sediment into Poyang from as far away as the Tibetan plateau.
The project would also allow water to rush in from the Yangtze during the winter dry season, the scientists said, drowning vegetation that grows in Poyang’s mud flats and provides a crucial food source for hundreds of species of migratory birds.
“Whatever’s built is going to be able to drown that entire system during the winter,” said James Burnham, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has researched how changes in China’s wetlands affect endangered water birds.
The Siberian crane, whose estimated 4,000 remaining individuals winter almost exclusively at Poyang because it is the closest lake to Siberia that does not freeze, is among Jiangxi’s best-known birds. But more than a dozen other threatened or endangered bird species depend on Poyang as a wintering site and would be threatened by the project, Mr. Burnham said.
Several prominent environmental groups have also criticized the project.
, which has been working to protect the endangered Yangtze finless porpoises that live in Poyang, has said that the project would “irreversibly and unpredictably” affect water quality and species diversity.
Zhang Yunbo, who heads 
, an environmental group based in Beijing, said that he was not categorically opposed to reasonable engineering solutions at Poyang, but that the complexity of the hydrological problems there made him wary of a large-scale engineering solution.
“Just because the water level is going down doesn’t mean we have to engineer the water levels,” Mr. Zhang said.
Some experts say that an alternative would be to stop the sand mining that appears to be 
 and causing more water to escape from the water channels that appear in Poyang’s mud flats during the winter. Much of the sand is used for construction in Shanghai, about 400 miles east, and other Chinese cities along the lower Yangtze River basin.
Officials at the Jiangxi Provincial Water Bureau declined a request for an interview and referred inquiries to the government’s report on the project.
Separately, local officials released some details in November from its environmental impact assessment of the project. But critics, including 
, the international environmental organization, said that the details did not allow for a full assessment by outsiders of the project’s likely ecological consequences.
 in the journal Scientific Reports found that reservoirs covering a total area equivalent to the size of Vermont had been constructed across China over the previous six decades, and that most of China’s large freshwater lakes — not including Poyang and Dongting, another freshwater lake in the Yangtze River basin — were regulated for irrigation, flood protection and other uses.
, one of the study’s authors and a geography professor at the 
, said the Chinese government’s approach to hydrological challenges was often driven by an “engineering mentality.” As a result, he said, the consequences of engineering projects — such as erosion — were often addressed with further engineering, even when less-intensive solutions might be more effective or less harmful to the watershed.
“We think the mentality must be changed,” Mr. Lu said in an interview.
Mr. Burnham said that stabilizing Poyang’s flood pulse would make its seasonal variations more predictable, potentially allowing for economic activities in places near the lake that were once at risk of flooding during the summer.
But he said it was unlikely that the migratory birds that feed at the lake during the winter dry season would see any benefits from the proposed sluice gate.
One of Mr. Burnham’s latest studies shows that when Poyang’s water levels were high during an unusually wet winter in 2011, Siberian cranes fled to nearby grasslands but did not absorb as many calories there as they normally do from vegetation in the lake’s mud flats. The study also says that grassland feeding could potentially slow the birds’ reproduction over the long term.
“There aren’t many other places for these birds to go: Poyang is the last, best place around,” Mr. Burnham said. “And if that’s no longer available, or if it gets altered to the point where it can’t be used anymore, you’re going to see a collapse of these species in the wild.”","As China’s Largest Freshwater Lake Shrinks, Solution Faces Criticism","DEC. 28, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/world/asia/china-lake-poyang-finless-porpoise.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MIKE IVES
"The case of a Tibetan entrepreneur who was detained after being featured in an article and 
 by The New York Times has taken an unusual turn, with Chinese prosecutors asking a court for more time to investigate as the judges were weighing a trial.
The prosecutors had sent the case against Tashi Wangchuk, 31, who is accused of inciting separatism, to the Yushu Intermediate Court in Qinghai Province in September. But this month, they asked the court to send the case back to them for further investigation, according to a judge and a defense lawyer.
The move is “very rare,” the lawyer, Lin Qilei, said in an interview. Prosecutors expect the additional investigation, which is likely to be carried out by the police, to be finished by Jan. 4, Mr. Lin said.
It is unclear what the development may signal about whether the court will accept the case against Mr. Tashi, a businessman who has advocated Tibetan language education on a personal blog and in interviews with The Times. If the court accepts the case for trial, Mr. Tashi, who has said he is not a separatist, will almost certainly be convicted.
Mr. Tashi has been detained for almost a year, in a case that has attracted intense international attention. On Dec. 10, Human Rights Day, the American ambassador to

 in which he mentioned a number of people being held by China, including Mr. Tashi, who he said was “in jail for his peaceful advocacy of Tibetan language education.”
Other organizations that have raised his case include 
 and PEN America, which noted Mr. Tashi’s detention in a 
 in September on China’s attempts to censor foreign reporting.
The international advocacy on behalf of Mr. Tashi may have contributed to the fact that the court has yet to accept the case. The Chinese legal system operates with little transparency and under political imperatives, often from senior Communist Party officials, so it is difficult to discern how decisions are made.
The police from Mr. Tashi’s hometown, Yushu, on the Tibetan Plateau, detained him in January, two months after he was quoted in a 
 and was featured in a Times documentary video on the same subject. Mr. Tashi was also quoted in a December 2015 story on a

Mr. Tashi was 
 for weeks. His relatives were not notified of his detention until March 24, in an apparent violation of Chinese law, which requires that a detainee’s family be told within 24 hours of the start of captivity. The police eventually 
 saying Mr. Tashi was being charged with inciting separatism, which can result in a 15-year prison sentence.
Prosecutors, known in China as the procuratorate, then asked the police twice to conduct further investigation. A judge with the Yushu Intermediate Court, who gave only his surname, Cui, said that the prosecutors had asked the court this month to send the case back to them for still more investigation and that the court had done so.
Another lawyer for Mr. Tashi, Liang Xiaojun, said in August that case files showed that the police had investigated Mr. Tashi 
. The police were focusing on the 
 that featured him, he said.
In the 2015 interviews, Mr. Tashi said that he did not support Tibetan independence. He said he simply wanted to promote greater Tibetan language education and use of the language in public life, a right that is guaranteed by the Chinese Constitution, which provides a framework for autonomy in ethnic regions of China.
Mr. Tashi also praised President Xi Jinping of China for having “promoted a democratic and law-abiding country these last few years.”
Mr. Tashi traveled to Beijing early last year to try to file a lawsuit against Yushu officials, accusing them of suppressing Tibetan language education. He tried to persuade Chinese state news organizations to report on those efforts.
He also came into contact with Times journalists in Beijing in May, and he met with them when they later traveled to Yushu. He repeatedly insisted that all his interviews be on the record and said he understood that they could potentially lead to his imprisonment.

"HONG KONG — President-elect 
’s golden quiff, bushy eyebrows and preening gestures were immortalized this week in 
 — though perhaps not in a way that he would like.
They appeared on a giant rooster statue, just above some three-toed feet and a blood-red wattle that hangs below a gilded nose and mouth.
The statue, which was installed outside a shopping mall in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan, was built to celebrate the coming Year of the Rooster in the Chinese lunar calendar and comes less than a month before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. It is 23 feet tall.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have been 
 in recent weeks. The tension is due in large part to Mr. Trump, who belittled China during his presidential campaign and caused a diplomatic stir this month by making clear that he views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing — 
 — as up for negotiation.
But reaction to the rooster on Chinese social media was light and full of positive emoji.
Global Times, a state-run tabloid, said on Tuesday that onlookers in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, had praised the statue as a “
.”
“It’s not bad looking,” Zhang Guoqiang, an employee at the Yihui Japanese Restaurant at the North America N1 Art Shopping Center, where the statue is, said by telephone on Thursday.
Inflatable “Trump chicken” replicas were on sale at Taobao, an online shopping bazaar, with a 32-foot version advertised for $1,725.
, an illustrator and animator in Seattle, said in a telephone interview that he completed the design in early November for Beijing Reliance Commercial Land, a real estate company that had contacted him through Behance, a website where artists post their portfolios. Mr. Latiolais said the company had asked only for a statue to commemorate the Year of the Rooster and did not mention Mr. Trump.
Mr. Latiolais, 30, declined to comment on why he had given the rooster Trump-like features. But he said he had been surprised by the size of the final product, which is made of fiberglass.
“This was way more yuge than I expected,” he 
.
Mr. Latiolais said that he was also surprised when the statue was “sort of bipartisanly looked at as funny” by his friends and family — including his parents, who voted for Mr. Trump.
It was not the first time since the American presidential election that people in China had likened Mr. Trump to a bird with notable hair.
In November, photos by a Chinese journalist of a golden pheasant with a blond pompadour and a red body circulated widely on social media and were 
 online by People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s main newspaper. The bird, which lives in a safari park in the eastern city of Hangzhou, became a star attraction there and a 
 for Hsiaohan Chen, a political cartoonist in Taipei.
Mr. Trump has a penchant for lashing out at his critics, however minor, on Twitter. But as of Thursday afternoon, he had not commented on either bird.",China Warmly Welcomes a Giant Rooster With Trumpian Characteristics,"DEC. 29, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/asia/trump-china-rooster-statue.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MIKE IVES
"ZHENGZHOU, China — A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China.
Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations.
The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers.
The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product.
It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.”
The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants.
It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets.
All of it in support of iPhone production.
“We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.”
American officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country.
Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.
In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world.
But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves.
China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to China to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn.
While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to American technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales.
A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.
It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations.
The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports.
As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale — and the sway that they afford in China — is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer.
The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here.
In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner.
Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.”
A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China.
President-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on American companies that move jobs overseas, 
 on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to 
China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, 
 and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly American technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security.
China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny.
 Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant 
. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country.
Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Mr. Trump in New York, part of an effort 
 with the incoming administration. It followed a similar good-will tour in China in August, when Mr. Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City.
The two countries are playing a high-stakes game.
Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages — 
 in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the United States.
As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs.
As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store.
Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone.
The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation.
The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year.
The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.
Apple was late to China.
In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated.
Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them — in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity.
“This is a machine that is made in America,” Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer.
Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how.
Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths — design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost.
“They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia.
When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.
Foxconn’s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.
“The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.”
After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China — unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations.
“These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters.
City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers.
The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory.
“We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.
The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park.
“I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.”
When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers.
But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers.
Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands.
Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports — hence, the U-turn employed by many companies.
In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China.
“This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.”
Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system.
By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country.
In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments.
Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility.
A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world.
As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy.
In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically.
The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company’s tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China.
“U.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income — income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.”
According to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the “holy grail of tax avoidance.” The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period.
Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union.
In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city’s iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends.
In August 2014, the city’s top leaders held a special meeting to discuss “deepening collaboration” with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the “biggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.”
There were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation’s crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city’s tax revenue was rapidly rising.
Officials had a name for it all: “Zhengzhou Speed.”
A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab.
They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones — up to 350 a minute.
Apple’s labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government.
As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers.
“Every city’s department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou.
The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.”
Cities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China.
As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology.
To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters.
The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue.
But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals — in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a 
“The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle. They’re not playing around anymore.”
Chinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price.
China is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increased 
 with new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused.
Apple has agreed to the government’s request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo “security audits” on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product.
Beijing also expects American companies to help develop China’s own capabilities. Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It has 
 in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies.
Mr. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple’s image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to China regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country’s top leaders, including Mr. Xi.
In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a “pillar of its environmental strategy.” He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple’s stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in China, half of them in manufacturing.
At the Hall of Purple Light in the government’s walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company’s first research and development center in the country and to support the government’s big focus on high-end manufacturing.

"BEIJING — Five people were killed in a clash at a branch of the Communist Party in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, the state news media reported on Thursday.
The authorities described the violence, which occurred on Wednesday, as a terrorist attack. They said that assailants armed with knives and a bomb stormed the Moyu County party offices in western Xinjiang, killing an official and a security guard. The police shot dead three people at the scene, 
, a state news agency.
The confrontation was the latest outburst of violence in a region plagued by tensions between the government and the 
, a mostly Muslim minority who inhabit Xinjiang, a desolate area that borders Kazakhstan, Mongolia and several other countries. It has been months since the government last reported an attack in the region.
China has waged a far-reaching campaign against what it calls Islamic extremism in the region in recent years, warning that separatists in Xinjiang are coordinating with jihadist groups abroad to carry out terrorist attacks in China.
But Uighur residents have disputed that characterization, arguing that repressive policies toward Muslims in the region, including strict limits on freedom of religion and speech, have provoked resistance.
In its report on the violence, Xinhua cited a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, but it did not identify the instigators. The local authorities described them simply as rioters.
But advocates for Uighurs raised doubts about the official account.
“We strongly question the reason given for the incident and the number of casualties reported by the government due to a lack of transparency,” said Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a group in Munich that advocates self-determination for Xinjiang.
Mr. Raxit, citing accounts from residents, said the authorities had arrested 20 people in Moyu, also known as Karakax County, in connection with the violence.
The Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
The confrontation erupted shortly before 5 p.m. on Wednesday, according to Xinhua. Several people emerged from a car and began attacking government employees with knives before detonating a bomb, Xinhua reported. A party official and a security guard were killed, according to Xinhua, and three others were injured.
In recent years, violence has surged in Xinjiang, and hundreds of people have died in conflicts between the government, run mostly by ethnic Han, the dominant group in China, and Uighurs.
Officials have tightened control over daily life in the region, by 
, for instance, and banning some residents from fasting during

On social media, many people praised the government’s handling of the clash, while others said they were concerned about ethnic tensions in Chinese society.

"BEIJING — The hotline rings, but nobody answers.
’s Ministry of Public Security opened the line last month to answer questions about the new law regulating foreign nonprofit organizations, which takes effect on Sunday.
But this week and last, calls went unanswered, exemplifying the uncertainty that still surrounds the law, raising concern among thousands of nongovernmental organizations about their ability to continue their work in the new year.
The law, which places a raft of new requirements on foreign nonprofits operating in China, is another building block in President Xi Jinping’s 
, which he sees as threatened by foreign influence and unfettered civil society.
Under the law, foreign nonprofits such as foundations, charities and many business associations must register with the police, persuade state agencies and organizations to act as their sponsors, and submit regular, detailed reports on their activities.
According to an official estimate, there are 7,000 foreign nongovernmental organizations in China. They range from well-known institutions like the Ford Foundation and Oxfam to groups of a few people working on issues like rural education, nature conservation and health care.
But groups working on politically sensitive issues like human rights, legal reform and the rule of law, or those concerning ethnic minorities, are seen as most at risk.
Some foreign organizations have already pulled back. The American Bar Association, which has a program providing training and support to strengthen the rule of law, recently closed its Beijing office until it could gain formal approval for its work.
Elizabeth Andersen, the association’s associate executive director, cited the “heightened scrutiny of foreign organizations working in China and the uncertainties and lack of information surrounding how the new law will be implemented.”
But the uncertainty has also unsettled groups far removed from political concerns. Numerous aspects of the law remain opaque, and many groups are anxious about the vagueness and expense of the new requirements, while some fear their work will be curtailed or even banned.
“Nothing’s clear,” said Corinne Richeux Hua, executive director of 
, a locally registered charity in Shanghai that organizes English teachers for children from the countryside. “We’ve got vague directives and guidelines.”
The local police, with whom her group must now register, had been helpful, but “they are still figuring it,” she said. “The rules haven’t been made completely clear to them yet.”
Ambiguity about how the law will be enforced is likely to make foreign groups extra cautious, and the Ministry of Public Security, which administers the law, “has every incentive to maintain uncertainty,” said 
, a political scientist at Middlebury College in Vermont who studies nongovernmental organizations in China.
“This will mean that the government is able to more closely monitor the foreign NGOs, and, more importantly, the Chinese citizens working and interacting with them, while allowing them to continue the work that the government deems beneficial,” Ms. Teets said by email. “The NGOs have every right to fear the closing off of space for advocacy and programs, but I think the impact will be really differentiated.”
Indeed, a Ministry of Public Security official 
 in Shanghai last month that “the Chinese government will continue welcoming and supporting foreign nongovernmental organizations coming to China.”
After Deng Xiaoping opened up China in the 1980s, foreign foundations, associations and charities became important channels for sharing money, ideas and inspiration. Officials often welcomed their help, especially in poorer parts of the country, even though the rules governing their status were murky.
But certain kinds of organizations, especially those that work in law and contentious social issues, have garnered distrust. Through the new law, the government wants to narrow permissible activities of foreign groups and monitor their work much more thoroughly.
A list of 
 of assistance issued last week suggested that foreign groups offering technical help on environmental, health and other relatively uncontroversial issues had strong chances of gaining approval.
Those working on legal issues will have a much narrower foothold. “Human rights,” for example, is not on the list of permitted issues.
“Rather than seeing foreign NGOs as potential partners who can help aid in economic, social and legal development in China, instead they see a latent threat that needs to be controlled,” said 
, the East Asia director of the Open Society Foundations, which has financed some work in China. “People on the international side are definitely worried. And well they should be. I think it will be difficult for many foreign NGOs working on legal reform to register. For those that are able to register, the law will likely restrict what they are able to do.”
Even before the new law, combative rights lawyers and advocates, feminists and labor activists have come under Mr. Xi’s heavy grip. 
, a Swedish citizen in Beijing, was arrested, forced to apologize on television and 
 early this year for working for an unregistered group that did low-key advocacy for legal rights.
The party sees groups like his as potential Trojan horses of political subversion. A 
 promoted by public security agencies this month warned that anti-party forces were “using foreign nongovernmental organizations to nurture ‘proxies’ and to establish a social basis” for insurrection.
The groups’ worries have been compounded by confusion about many requirements, the belated release of crucial rules, and signs that public security bureaus are poorly prepared for their new role.
But it is not just activists and charities who are concerned. The opaque rules mean that organizations such as business groups, universities and education programs that seemingly pose no political threat are also unclear whether they must register for some of their activities.
“Business and trade associations, civil society, environmental groups and educational institutions that are concerned about how their operations in China may be affected” have met with American diplomats to discuss the law, said Mary Beth Polley, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Beijing.
“We remain deeply concerned about the uncertainties and potentially hostile environment for foreign nonprofit, nongovernment organizations and their Chinese partners that this law creates,” she said.
Foreign organizations working in China have long had to seek out domestic agencies or organizations to act as their sponsors. But the new law narrows the list of permissible sponsors, and those permitted may be reluctant to take on the risk of vouching for foreign groups, or feel they do not have the personnel available for the task.
“Who wants to assume this burden?” asks 
, a partner in the Beijing office of the WilmerHale law firm who has been advising companies and organizations on the new law. “I think there’s a real issue of capacity. The NGO community serves as an important ballast for relationships, and if this is mishandled, it won’t help.”
While some foreign organizations are resigned to months of uncertainty, some said they would keep working full time in the country, confident that public security offices will let them stay open while the registration is ironed out. Several American trade associations said they thought they would be allowed to stay, and some groups said they looked forward to gaining official status under the new rules.
“We see these new regulations as a pretty positive thing for us,” said 
, the acting chief representative in Beijing of WildAid, which works with the Chinese government to fight illegal trading in wildlife. “We have a big presence here, but we’ve never been completely officially on the books.”
But organizations working on legal issues or social problems said they were unsure of their futures and may face hard choices. Registration may mean sacrificing autonomy, but the alternative may be abandoning people in China who need their help, said Mr. Kellogg of the Open Society Foundations.
“I would urge foreign NGOs to adopt a wait-and-see attitude before they make any final decisions about either registering or pulling out of China,” he said. “Once there is more clarity about how the law will be enforced, it will be at least a bit easier to come up with mitigation strategies.”",Uncertainty Over New Chinese Law Rattles Foreign Nonprofits,"DEC. 29, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/asia/china-foreign-ngo.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"BEIJING — For the past two years, Wu Dongmei’s 14-year-old son has been attending a private school in Shanghai that offers an international program that prepares students for higher education abroad. All had proceeded smoothly — until recently, she said.
On Oct. 19, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission summoned the principals of 21 local private schools to explain draft regulations that would restrict international programs in Grades 1 through 9, the years of compulsory education in 
. The commission accused schools that had replaced the officially mandated curriculum, which includes classes in political ideology, of “infringing on China’s education sovereignty.”
The commission said that under the proposed regulations the authorities would no longer approve the establishment of any new private schools with “foreign influence” and would “bar foreign investment in private schools.” School curriculums would be monitored to ensure that they “uphold national sovereignty and ideology.” Private schools could not be named after foreigners.
The rules would not apply to international schools set up primarily to educate foreign students.
A woman who answered the telephone at the commission’s office this week said that it was unclear when the new regulations, if approved, might take effect, but that any information would be posted on the commission’s 
. The woman declined to give her name.
Now Ms. Wu is worried that the programs her son, who is in the ninth grade, is enrolled in might be replaced.
“Parents have been talking about the regulations, and some are even prepared to send their kids to schools overseas if there are major changes,” she said in an interview. She asked that her son’s school not be identified, out of concern that it might cause problems for him.
, a researcher in Beijing for the Harvard University 
, said the proposed Shanghai regulations reflected the Chinese government’s concerns about political orthodoxy.
“The government has maintained tight ideological control over the universities, and high schools are entirely focused on test preparation, but there has been room for innovation in the grades 1-to-9 system,” Mr. Jiang said. “As the Chinese economy slows and instability grows, the government wants to ensure maximum control in the classroom.”
, 256 private and 225 public schools in China provide international education programs for Chinese students who hope to continue their studies abroad. These typically offer English or other courses students would need to prepare for foreign universities, instead of courses equipping them to take 
, the Chinese college entrance examination.
Many private schools also omit the ideological instruction on Marxism and patriotism that is compulsory in public schools.
Ms. Wu wondered whether the government might also require such courses in private schools, which have a high degree of autonomy in devising curriculums and teaching methods. “I believe politics should be separated from school education, although I know in China it’s difficult,” she said.
Investment in private schools across China has surged in recent decades. 
 from 2015 showed that China had 10,735 private schools offering grades 1 through 9, with more than 12 million students. That is more than 8.5 percent of all the students in these grades, up from 2.9 percent in 2004.
Driving the trend are wealthy families willing to pay for what they see as a higher-quality education. Some real estate developers have promoted private schools as features to help sell apartments. Local government officials have accepted private schools as a way to provide more consumer choice as well as stimulate the local economy, despite concerns that they exacerbate social inequality.
“Because private schools offer more money and autonomy” to staff members, Mr. Jiang said, “they’ve been draining a lot of top talent from the public school system. So while private schools promise to shake up an overly bureaucratic school system in China, they do so at the expense of equity and social mobility.”
But since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, the private and international education sectors have come under greater government scrutiny. In November, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted revisions to a law 
 from offering classes for grades 1 through 9. According to Zhu Zhiwen, a vice minister of education, none of China’s registered private schools are for-profit, and the law only affects those who want to turn their schools into profit-led establishments, the state news media 
.
This is not the first crackdown on Western values in Chinese education. At a forum last year on ideological work in universities, Yuan Guiren, then the education minister, 
 “never let textbooks promoting Western values appear in our classes.” Later that year, the Communist Party’s propaganda department and the Ministry of Education pushed universities to 
.
Mr. Jiang said that grades 1 through 9 were the most important for a child’s psychological and emotional development, which may explain the official focus on early education.
“It is a period when the children are most impressionable, and begin developing habits, values and modes of thinking,” Mr. Jiang said. “China does not want a situation where its elite are too westernized.”
Mr. Jiang thinks there might be moves to discourage Chinese students from studying abroad in the near future — even though Mr. Xi’s own daughter attended Harvard.
But in a city like Shanghai, with a growing middle class that prefers choices in education and lifestyles, it is unclear exactly what effect the proposed regulations may have in the classroom. What is clear is that they have already upset many parents.
“I think the Chinese education system is like an assembly line,” Ms. Wu said, explaining why she wanted her son to have an international education. “If you conform, you’re fine. But if you’re different, you’re eliminated.”
“The day we parents sent our kids to private schools, we knew there was no way back,” she said. “It’s a different system, leading to different futures.”",Shanghai’s Move to Curb International Programs in Schools Worries Parents,"DEC. 29, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/asia/shanghai-schools-international-curriculum.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,KAROLINE KAN
"JIAYUGUAN, China — The fortress stands watch in a parched land with snow-encrusted mountains beyond, a lone rook on the empty chessboard of western 
’s Gobi Desert.
All around spread the sands of solitude, which through the centuries have served as a passage for armies, merchants, monks, envoys and explorers. Those entering or leaving the fort passed by the sign hanging from a tower: “The first and greatest pass under heaven.”
For more than 600 years, Jiayuguan, translated as Jiayu Fort or Jiayu Pass, has been the anchor of the westernmost point of the Ming-era Great Wall, a series of monumental ramparts that stretches a winding, mountainous 5,500 miles from here to the Yalu River, on the North Korean border.
Under the Ming, who ruled China for nearly three centuries, as many as 1,000 soldiers used Jiayuguan as a garrison. Beyond it were the “western regions,” the lands of largely nomadic people considered barbarians by the ethnic Han.
Few structures in the world are as iconic as the Great Wall, which reached its definitive form under the Ming dynasty. Though Jiayuguan was an important marker of the Chinese Empire’s frontier, it has long been overshadowed by sections of the wall outside Beijing.
Now, city and provincial officials here are on a campaign to grow international interest in Jiayuguan’s heritage and transform the area from a center of steel production to both a tourism destination and a cultural oasis in the desert.
“There has always been interest in the history of Jiayuguan,” said Zhang Xiaodong, director of the Jiayuguan Great Wall Museum, which is next to the ancient fort. “From a historic perspective, Jiayuguan and the wall were mainly used for military defense.”
But in a broader sense, he said, the Great Wall “represents the Chinese nation’s spirits: the working people’s wisdom, their perseverance to become stronger and the ability to fend off enemies’ intrusion.”
Great walls built to repel the “other’’ have recently become part of the global conversation, sparked by politics and popular culture. The global hit “Game of Thrones” has an ice wall that separates so-called civilization from an army of the undead. President-elect Donald J. Trump, who promised 
 between the United States and Mexico, has compared his plan to the Chinese Great Wall. He even said it would be named the “Great Wall of Trump.”
This month, theaters in China began showing 
 a fantasy action movie starring Matt Damon, directed by 
 and produced by Chinese and American companies. The film’s conceit is that the wall was built to keep out monsters. Mr. Zhang, China’s most famous director, shot scenes in the deserts of Gansu Province, where Jiayuguan is, though not at the fort itself.
“We definitely did make the connection with Gansu Province as the terminus, or start, of the Silk Road and the perfect area for our heroes to enter China,” said 
, a producer.
I visited Jiayuguan while on a recent 
 trip across Gansu. I had been here once before, as a backpacker in 1999, when few tourists came. My father had passed by nearly a half-century earlier.
The high-speed rail route opened in 2014 and follows the old Silk Road along the barren Hexi Corridor, a strip of high plains that runs between two mountain ranges and that historically bridged the ethnic Han regions of interior China to the western edge of the empire.
Jiayuguan is already benefiting from the arrival of the high-speed railway and growing interest in the Great Wall. During China’s big October holiday week, Jiayuguan received 442,800 visitors, a 22 percent increase over the same time last year, according to the China National Tourism Administration.
A 2014 provincial document designated Jiayuguan as one of eight Gansu tourism zones to be developed by next year, bolstered with favorable land, financial and tax policies. In October, Jiayuguan’s Communist Party chief, Liu Peng, said that steel production was a drain on resources and that it was critical to expand tourism.
Two new tourist parks are being built in the area, and an annual cross-desert car rally passes through Jiayuguan. The town is also the unlikely site of a new annual 
 that hosts international filmmakers.
Near the wall are underground tombs from the Wei and Jin dynasties, which were discovered in 1972 by a shepherd and existed for more than a millennium before the fort was built. There are as many as 1,000 of the tombs, though only one is open to the public. Most striking are the small bricks that make up their interior walls — many have an individual scene that evokes daily life: feasts, farming, herding horses and camels.
Jiayuguan falls in the heart of the Silk Road region that is the foundation of the 
 transnational economic plan that President Xi Jinping has been promoting. By emphasizing Silk Road history, officials are highlighting eras in Chinese history when the Great Wall represented openness to the outside world rather than insularity and xenophobia.
Jiayuguan sits along one of the narrowest parts of the Hexi Corridor. Camel caravans laden with goods traversed the route. The strip is only nine miles wide at Jiayuguan, and so it was easy to guard. “This landscape made it difficult for cavalries to pass,” Mr. Zhang, the museum director, said.
Last year, workers completed a four-year, $290-million restoration of the fort, which dates to 1372.
In addition to the fort, two other notable remnants of history are scattered around the Jiayuguan area: a section of the rammed-earth Great Wall that has an eroded beacon tower and a stretch of the wall that winds steeply over hills, as it does outside Beijing.
Because of their recent restoration, the fort and the winding wall feel like film sets. On the afternoon I visited, tour groups poured from buses to clamber up to the fort’s ramparts. Atop the battlements are three-story temple-style buildings with red wooden pillars and long curved eaves.
Viewed from the battlements, the sands stretch to the horizon, and it is not hard to imagine phantoms of the frontier’s ancient inhabitants drifting across them at twilight.
For millenniums, the Hexi Corridor has been occupied and controlled by various cultures and civilizations. Ethnic Qiang, Tibetans and Mongolians each held sway. Under the Ming, 
 asked to settle in Jiayuguan, and eventually they moved even farther east. I visited their descendants, 
, on the same train trip.
Luo Zhewen, a prominent architectural historian, wrote in a 1977 paper that Jiayuguan was “a great testimony showing the unification process of our country with many ethnic groups.” The words echo Communist Party positions.
After the Ming were toppled by a peasant rebellion, China was invaded by ethnic Manchus, who breached the Great Wall at the coastal fort of Shanhaiguan with the help of a treasonous general. The Manchus established the Qing dynasty. Under them, the wall became almost meaningless as a frontier border — after all, the Manchus were “barbarians” from beyond the wall.
“It ceases to serve as the boundary between civilization and barbarity, between the lands of the Hua and the lands of the Yi,” said Mark Elliott, a Qing historian at Harvard University. “It goes from playing a marker between us and them, between inner and outer, and then it becomes an internal border.”
Because the Communists are trying to hold onto most of the vast territory of the Qing, despite all the problems this entails, Jiayuguan has not been restored to its original role as a frontier marker. That was apparent even in the early days of Communist rule, when my father was posted as a soldier of the People’s Liberation Army far beyond Jiayuguan, to nomadic lands on the nation’s outer rim.
In the autumn of 1951, he rode past the Great Wall at Jiayuguan in an army truck. The railway had not been built yet. The wall was crumbling. “No one went there in those days,” he told me. “The wall was made of earth, not bricks, and it was in bad condition.”
As the truck continued west, the wall vanished, and around him stretched nothing but the timeless sands.","As Interest Grows in Great Walls, an Ancient Chinese Fortress Beckons","DEC. 29, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/asia/great-wall-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EDWARD WONG
"BEIJING — An angry mob ransacks a terminal. A frustrated passenger tries to leave the plane while it taxis. A pilot, who has had it up to here, advises fliers to leave the plane and mill about the tarmac — and they do.
Welcome to 
’s unfriendly skies. The world’s second-largest economy boasts some of the world’s worst flight delays and missed connections. Angry passengers have become such a fixture of flying in China that the government has developed a blacklist for the dangerously unruly.
Chinese leaders are aware of the problem. Spurred by the strain on the air traffic system as well as a slowing economy, China has begun a huge airport building project that could give the country 60 more airports beyond the current total of about 200 by 2020. It committed to spending $12 billion on airport construction and revamping this year alone.
A $12 billion airport under construction 30 miles southwest of Beijing’s center will eventually more than double the city’s air traffic capacity. The new airport, Daxing International, will have up to seven runways and 7.5 million square feet of floor space.
Frequent visitors to Beijing may get a feeling they have seen this before. Less than a decade ago, the newly built international terminal at the city’s old airport became 
 of China’s industrial might and political willpower. But last year, the old airport handled nearly 90 million passengers — 10 million more than it was built for.
“It’s not a question of whether there will be enough passengers,” said Jia Zhiguo, an assistant general manager for the airport construction project. “It’s whether we will be able to handle all of the passengers.”
China has unleashed a huge spending spree to prop up its slowing economy, raising concerns about its growing debt and its surplus of such things as steel factories and coal plants. But Daxing shows that despite China’s economic ascension, decades of major construction projects and worries about overcapacity, the fast-growing and increasingly affluent country still has basic infrastructure needs it has to meet.
“Infrastructure investment in China is often misallocated because of the inadequacies of strategic planning, the availability of essentially free credit, and the lack of consequences for the builders and local governments when investments do not yield sufficient returns,” said Scott Kennedy, the deputy director of the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
As Chinese pockets have deepened and leisure time has grown, so has the flood of air traffic in China. Chinese airlines ferried 440 million passengers in 2015, with that number 
 to 1.19 billion by 2034.
That has led to frustrating delays. Airports in Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing ranked at the bottom for on-time departures among 100 major airports in November, according to FlightStats, a flight information provider. Airports in Xiamen, Guangzhou, Kunming and Beijing were not much better. This year, China’s aviation regulators 
 airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing from adding more flights until they could improve their on-time flight record.
“I travel around China frequently, and there’s always a problem,” said Paul Adkins, managing director of AZ China Ltd., a consulting firm. Once, his short flight from Shanghai to Beijing became a 24-hour gantlet that included sleeping over at a college dormitory and being locked in a bus without air-conditioning for an hour. Another time, he and fellow passengers were ordered to run through the airport for a plane that had already left.
“How many times have we sat in the plane at the gate waiting for clearance?” Mr. Adkins said in an email. “The best way to manage hundreds of passengers is to bottle them up inside the airplane.”
Stories and 
 of passengers losing their cool have become staples of the Chinese internet. One video, which went viral three years ago, shows an airline employee who has to be restrained from attacking a passenger who beaned him on the head with a water bottle.
“It was by far the wildest thing I ever saw at an airport anywhere,” said Matthew Sheehan, a journalist who shot the video.
Crowded skies are only part of the problem. About four-fifths of China’s airspace is 
 by the military, which can 
 if needed. A decentralized regional air traffic control system creates additional barriers for commercial aircraft flying domestically. In 2015, 
 of China’s flight delays were a result of air traffic control restrictions.
China’s risk-averse aviation institutions also enforce a much higher standard of operation in the name of safety, which can decrease airport efficiency. In the United States or Europe, flights at major airports land every 30 seconds or so, said David Yu, the Asia executive director at IBA Group, an aircraft consultancy. In China, the gap can be three times that to minimize the chances of an accident.
“The levels of activity we’re seeing in China and the tremendous growth in air traffic has obviously made the air traffic controllers unable to catch up,” he said. “They know that they’re cautious. It’s a learning curve from their point of view.”
So far it works: China’s major airlines are 
.
The airport construction site — a muddy expanse dotted with lumbering trucks and a dizzying array of cranes — is a hive of activity. There are workers on site 24 hours a day to complete the airport in time. Much of the initial construction for the transportation hub underneath the airport is hidden from sight, but scaffolding outlines the basic contours of the main terminal.
Daxing’s first terminal is scheduled to be open by 2019. The hub underneath will connect the airport by 
 and train to the neighboring cities of Hebei and Tianjin as well as to Beijing. It was designed by the French airport design firm ADPI and Zaha Hadid Architects.
The design of the terminal, with docking piers radiating out like the spokes of a wheel, has attracted its 
. Online, the airport is sometimes 
 the “Patrick airport,” a reference to the pink starfish character from the cartoon series “SpongeBob SquarePants
“This is the most compact form you can have for an airport terminal with that capacity,” said Cristiano Ceccato, an associate at Hadid Architects who helped put together the winning bid for the design. “In the end it was simple geometry. There’s only so many ways you stack people or stack planes around to maximize contact with something at minimum distance.”
That compactness means that walking between the two farthest points in the first terminal should take no longer than eight minutes. The airport’s six piers have been designed to create additional contact areas to house more gates, thus increasing the number of flights the airport can handle each hour.
“It’s part of a new airport typology which is just emerging, but it has been taken much further in this new one,” said Henrik Rothe, a senior lecturer in airport design at Cranfield University in England.
When completed, the airport’s first terminal will be able to handle 45 million passengers a year. Two additional phases will bump up the total capacity to 100 million by 2040.
Don’t expect everything to be ready in the first phase of construction, though, planners warn. “An airport at this scale hasn’t been built before,” Mr. Rothe said. “The expectation to be working from day one is quite high.”",China Builds Out the Air as Frustrations Mount Below,"DEC. 29, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/business/china-airport-flight-delays.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EMILY FENG
"BEIJING — A top Chinese official suggested that Catholic churches in 
 should be run independently of the 
, the state news media reported on Friday, striking a nationalistic tone as the country negotiates a possible deal to improve relations with the Vatican.
At a meeting with bishops on Thursday in Beijing, 
, a senior Communist Party leader, endorsed the notion of a self-governed Chinese Catholic church,

, the two sides are still grappling with issues such as who has the authority to appoint bishops in China.
Religious leaders and scholars were divided on the significance of Mr. Yu’s remarks, which came after a three-day meeting of Catholic bishops representing state-run churches from across the country. Mr. Yu is one of seven members of the party’s Politburo Standing Committee, the group of politicians who govern China.
Some said the willingness of Mr. Yu to meet with Catholic leaders signaled a genuine desire for reconciliation with the Vatican. Others saw his embrace of party talking points as a worrisome sign.
, a senior researcher in Beijing at 
 who has closely followed Vatican affairs, said that despite Mr. Yu’s emphasis on patriotism, the government seemed less critical of the Vatican over all at the meeting.
“You can see that the two sides are walking in lock step,” Mr. Sisci said. “There is growing agreement and growing optimism.”
Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has worked to build a closer relationship with China, snapping photos with Chinese bishops in St. Peter’s Square and sending greetings to President 
.
In recent months, there have been signs of progress and renewed hope about a deal. But there have also been setbacks. Last week, for example, the Vatican expressed frustration when a bishop who was not appointed by the pope was present at the ordination of two new Chinese bishops.
Before the meeting of bishops this week, the Vatican 
 it was looking for “positive signs” from Beijing. On Tuesday, Wang Zuoan, head of China’s State Administration for Religious Affairs, 
, “We hope the Vatican will take practical actions to create favorable conditions for the improvement in ties.’’
Leaders of so-called underground churches, which operate without the state’s approval, have expressed unease about the negotiations, worried the Vatican might make too many concessions to China. A third or more of China’s estimated nine million to 12 million Catholics worship in underground congregations.
Dong Baolu, a bishop at an underground church in the northern province of Hebei, said the comments made by officials this week indicated that the party would not give up any real power.
“China will go about its religious affairs by its own standards, and that’s a rebuttal of the Vatican,” he said in an interview.
Mr. Dong, who did not attend the meeting in Beijing, said he was in a difficult position as the leader of a church not recognized by the Chinese government.

"BEIJING — A former top Chinese security official who reportedly amassed an illicit fortune has been expelled from the Communist Party and will be prosecuted, the 
 on Friday.
The official, Ma Jian, a former vice minister of the Ministry of State Security, was said to have taken bribes and used his post to enrich his relatives, according to a brief statement posted on the website of the Communist Party’s anticorruption agency. He was also accused of interfering in legal processes, the statement said.
Mr. Ma, who had been 
, was the latest victim of a far-reaching campaign against corruption led by President Xi Jinping. Mr. Xi has promised to go after high- and low-level officials alike, and the expulsion of Mr. Ma, a former leader of one of 
’s most powerful and feared agencies, seemed aimed at underscoring the president’s resolve.
“They’re sending a message that they won’t go easy on someone just because he’s an official,” said Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University of China in Beijing. “If a person commits crimes, that person should also be held accountable.”
In China, the party maintains strong influence over courts, and Mr. Ma will almost certainly face conviction and imprisonment.
In another high-profile case, Mr. Xi’s government sentenced a powerful security official, 
, the nation’s former chief of domestic security, to life in prison last year, accusing him of abuse of power, accepting bribes and revealing state secrets. Mr. Zhou was the most senior leader to be jailed for corruption in more than 65 years of Communist rule.
In its statement on Friday, the anticorruption agency, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said Mr. Ma had “seriously violated political discipline and the code of conduct.” It said he had improperly hidden money and real estate, though it did not provide details.
The Chinese news media had previously reported that Mr. Ma, who worked for the Ministry of State Security for more than three decades and helped oversee counterespionage operations, was under investigation for using his position to help a businessman from Henan Province.

 centuries ago, no longer welcomes him.
Remarks by its foreign minister this past month were the latest sign that another country had withered under pressure from 
 over the contentious issue of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.
The minister, Tsend Munkh-Orgil, told the Onoodor newspaper that the government “feels sorry” for allowing the Dalai Lama to visit Mongolia in November and that the Dalai Lama “probably won’t be visiting Mongolia again during this administration,” according to 
. The Foreign Ministry confirmed the remarks, according to The Associated Press.
The reaction by Mongolia surprised some scholars because of the country’s deep ties to the Dalai Lama, which date from the 1500s. Even the title alludes to those roots: Dalai means “ocean” in Mongolian.
The Chinese government had 
 to the visit by the Dalai Lama, which began on Nov. 18 and took place over four days, even though it was not made at the invitation of the Mongolian government and was religious in nature. China canceled meetings with senior Mongolian officials in response.
China has long pressured countries, including Western ones, to ban visits from the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. Chinese Communist Party leaders consider him to be an enemy who advocates Tibetan independence from China, although the Dalai Lama has said he seeks only greater autonomy for Tibetans.
In one sense, Mongolia’s reaction to China, a neighbor that has the world’s second-largest economy, was predictable. Mongolia is dealing with financial problems and is seeking a large loan from Beijing. Until a recent crash, the Mongolian economy had been growing fast, fueled by mineral extraction.
But, at the same time, Mongolia has tried to distance itself from China and Russia, and has become a United States military partner.
It is also a traditionally Buddhist country with ancient ties to Tibetan Buddhism and to the history of the Dalai Lamas, and the foreign minister’s remarks alarmed some historians and 
 advocates.
“This is part of a near-global collapse in diplomatic capacity to handle certain kinds of pressure from China, which is, of course, far more acute for small, landlocked neighbors than major powers,” 
, a historian of modern Tibet at Columbia University, said in an email.
, a China historian at Yonsei University in Seoul, 
 that Mongolia’s reaction was “ironic given that it was a Mongolian Khan who invented Dalai Lamaness.”
The Dalai Lamas arose from the actions of Altan Khan, a 16th-century Mongolian leader who controlled a region next to northern China, which was ruled by the ethnic Han emperors of the Ming dynasty.
Three centuries earlier, Kublai Khan, the founding emperor of the Yuan dynasty, an era when Mongolians ruled China, had become interested in Tibetan Buddhism and had taken on a Tibetan teacher.
But it was Altan Khan who made Tibetan Buddhism an official religion among Mongols. He did this when the head of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, also known as the Yellow Hat school, visited him in 1577. On that occasion, Altan Khan 
 of Dalai Lama. With Dalai meaning “ocean” in Mongolian and Lama being a Tibetan spiritual teacher, the title translates as “ocean of wisdom.”
This bound the Mongols and Tibetans and established a relationship between Mongolian rulers and the Gelug school. Since then, the position of the Dalai Lama has been tied to complex politics in Asia. The two heads of the Gelug school preceding the one who visited Altan Khan were also given the Dalai Lama title retroactively.
The Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso, the one who had received his title from Altan Khan, 
 in the Mongolian region. A great-grandson of Altan Khan, Yonten Gyatso, was then named by senior Tibetan lamas as the Fourth Dalai Lama and the reincarnation of Sonam Gyatso. (Each Dalai Lama is considered a reincarnation of the previous one.) Yonten Gyatso has been the only Mongolian to be chosen as a Dalai Lama.
The Dalai Lama’s Mongolia visit has raised another question. Many people 
 over when and where the reincarnation of the current Dalai Lama, the 14th, will appear after he dies. The Dalai Lama, who is 81, has said that he may be the last of the Dalai Lamas, while holding open the possibility of a reincarnation — including one outside Tibetan regions, where Communist leaders would no doubt try to control any designated reincarnation.
Some people have said that the next Dalai Lama could be found in the 
 of northeastern India, 
. Tawang also happens to be a disputed region in the Himalayas that China claims as its territory.
But the Dalai Lama’s recent visit suggests to some scholars that Mongolia could be the place to watch, especially given the history of the Third and Fourth Dalai Lamas.
“The interesting thing about the Dalai Lama visit was that it may be a signal that his reincarnation could appear there,” Mr. Barnett said. He added that given China’s hostility, this is “something that would be potentially disastrous for Mongolia.”","Mongolia, With Deep Ties to Dalai Lama, Turns From Him Toward China","DEC. 30, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/world/asia/china-mongolia-dalai-lama.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EDWARD WONG
"Pan Pan, a giant panda whose virility helped spawn an entire generation of the notoriously difficult-to-breed animals, died this week at a conservation center in China’s Sichuan Province.
At 31, Pan Pan was thought to be the world’s oldest male panda. He died early Wednesday morning at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency in China. Pandas in the wild generally live to be about 20, but often survive longer in captivity.
“Pan Pan was the equivalent to about 100 human years, but he had been living with cancer, and his health had deteriorated in the past three days,” Tan Chengbin, a keeper at the conservation center,

“He was living a quiet, comfortable life in the geriatric wing of the Dujiangyan Giant Panda Base where he was given the very best of care,” it said. “He fought a brave battle against cancer but ultimately it won.”
Pan Pan was born in the wild in 1985 and taken into captivity shortly after, 
. As part of a breeding program, he was especially successful at impregnating female pandas, a notoriously difficult feat 
 that is fertile for only two or three days each year.
(Of the difficulties in breeding pandas, Scientific American 
, “There is perhaps no mammal that is less often in the mood for sex than the female giant panda.”)
A spokesman for the panda conservation center in Sichuan told CNN that Pan Pan had “a strong physique” in his youth, which apparently helped when it came to impregnating female pandas.
“Pan Pan was really fast and agile when he was young,” the spokesman said.
 that Pan Pan had more than 130 descendants, and that his offspring and their cubs accounted for nearly a quarter of the more than 420 captive pandas alive worldwide today.
His descendants are found in zoos around the world. He sired Bai Yun, the giant panda who has lived at the San Diego Zoo since 1996, and he was the grandfather of Tai Shan, who in 2005 became the first surviving panda cub born in captivity at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.

"For the final 
 Today newsletter of 2016, a selection of articles by New York Times correspondents who regularly report from the country.
None of the articles involve the year’s major news event, the devastating 
 fire, which miraculously did not directly cause any deaths. Some of our picks don’t even involve news as such. But all of them are articles that we think are worth revisiting:
• Dan Levin’s look at the 
of the Chinese community in Vancouver, British Columbia, was particularly popular among online readers. The article begins: “Andy Guo, an 18-year-old Chinese immigrant, loves driving his red Lamborghini Huracán. He does not love having to share the car with his twin brother, Anky.”
• Craig S. Smith looked into the history and growing popularity of the variety of 
, Nova Scotia. “Many people in Scotland considered the Cape Breton style — fiddling and dancing, in particular — as frozen in time,” Mr. Smith wrote. “The music helped spark a cultural revival in the old country.”
• I traveled up to Keewaywin, a small First Nations community in northwestern Ontario that can be reached only by air, or by traveling over ice roads in the winter, to do reporting for one of the most disturbing articles I’ve written. Seven teenagers from remote indigenous communities, included Keewaywin, left to attend high school in Thunder Bay, Ontario. 
Despite months of testimony, a coroner’s inquest was unable to determine what had led to the deaths of four of the students. The other three deaths were found to be accidental. But the underfunding of education for indigenous students seemed to be a common denominator in all the cases.
 a talented, young photographer from Toronto who often works for The Times, provided some exceptional photographs for the article.
(A brief follow-up: 
, who was the principal of the high school the students attended and who is from Keewaywin, has since become the principal of a school for indigenous students in Toronto.)
• Finally, Jodi Kantor and Catrin Einhorn have spent the past year producing a series of three articles about 
and their interactions with Canadians helping them out.
Mr. Smith, who worked in Asia until recently for The Times, looked back at 
which took place 75 years ago this month. The failed defense of what was then a British colony against Japanese troops cost 3,000 lives, including those of 290 Canadians.
“These days, the sacrifice and courage of those who died are remembered more than the senselessness of their deaths,” Mr. Smith wrote. “But historians have long acknowledged that it was a mistake to send untested Canadian boys to defend an indefensible island.”
At the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in October, Ed Whitlock, 85, became the oldest person to run 26.2 miles in less than four hours. Mr. Whitlock’s time, 3 hours 56 minutes 34 seconds, was just one of many age-related athletic records he has recorded. 
that Mr. Whitlock takes an unconventional approach to preparation: “He has no coach. He follows no special diet. He does not chart his mileage. He wears no heart-rate monitor. He takes no ice baths, gets no massages. He shovels snow in the winter and gardens in the summer but lifts no weights, does no situps or push-ups. He avoids stretching, except the day of a race. He takes no medication, only a supplement that may or may not help his knees.”
Not surprisingly, Mr. Whitlock is also of great interest to scientists who study aging.

"BEIJING — The two-minute cartoon opens with a folksy jingle and a smiling bobblehead of President 
, dimpled and cherubic. Then it cuts to a colorful montage praising his government for improving the lives of ordinary Chinese with what might seem like a mundane policy: regulations allowing taxis to be summoned online.
With vivid animation and quirky sound effects, the video does not feel like propaganda. But its creators, a team of 15 people hired by the state-run media, spent months obsessing over the details, down to the shape of Mr. Xi’s grin. Their mission: to promote Mr. Xi and the ruling Communist Party in a voice that resonates with 
’s digitally savvy millennials.
“There isn’t any dry language or political jargon,” said Ma Changbo, 35, a former journalist who is the chief executive of the multimedia studio behind the clip, which was published online by China Central Television, the state broadcaster. “People can relate to it.”
Decades after Mao Zedong declared the pen as important to political power as the gun, the party still churns out old-school propaganda — colorful posters with wooden slogans, mawkish movies with patriotic themes, meticulously censored newspapers written in dry, impenetrable language. The evening news is as rigid as ever, almost always opening with Mr. Xi and often featuring the reading of long party communiqués.
But Mr. Xi is demanding that the propaganda apparatus step up its game.
His administration has 
as ineffective, too slow to assert control over the internet and lacking in their commitment to Marxist values. He is pushing them to master the tools of digital media, resist foreign influences in popular culture and target younger audiences, a demographic that some in the party worry it may be losing.
The fruits of his campaign are popping up online. In addition to a more aggressive effort to stamp out criticism and amplify support on social media, the party has invested millions in animated videos that cast Mr. Xi as a compassionate champion of Chinese workers. Scholars have delivered TED-style talks that rail against Western imperialism. Hip-hop songs pay homage to party history and warn of America’s efforts to topple the Chinese government.
It is unclear how effective such tactics will be in winning over a younger generation that is more skeptical of prepackaged messages and increasingly connected to the outside world. Nor is the party’s ability to modernize and reorient its vast propaganda apparatus — perhaps the world’s largest — guaranteed. But there is widespread agreement that the old methods are no longer enough.
“If the government wants to reach this audience they have to use new media to do it,” said 
, an expert in Chinese propaganda at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, adding that many young people have grown accustomed to bypassing official censorship.
Mr. Xi is trying to increase confidence in the party as it contends with a slowing economy. The campaign also underscores his determination to shore up China’s image abroad as it moves to capitalize on political discord in the West and win new allies. Top party officials have called on news outlets to embrace digital media to help “spread Chinese voices” around the globe.
Inside the offices of 
, the party’s flagship newspaper since 1946, editors are turning to video and animation to enliven stories about government policies and appeal to foreign audiences. When Mr. Xi visited the United States in 2015, for example, they 
 in which foreign students in China offered fawning assessments of his performance. (“Xi Dada, so cute,” an Austrian student said, invoking a popular nickname for Mr. Xi.)
Ye Zhenzhen, 40, who oversees “new media” for the newspaper group and prefers not to use the word propaganda to describe his work, said the videos were aimed at helping foreigners get beyond clichés about political oppression and corruption in China. But he added that finding new ways to talk about China was also a business necessity.
“We can’t simply rely on traditional forms of content,” he said. “We need to diversify and put ourselves in our customers’ shoes.”
The government’s interest in new forms of propaganda has created a booming market for digital media enthusiasts with a nationalist bent.
Mr. Ma, whose multimedia studio, Shizhi Media, produced the taxi cartoon, said about a fifth of its clients were party or state entities. The video about the taxi initiative, for example, was produced for China Central Television in September as part of a contract to promote the work of a party body known as the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms, 1,000 days after it was formed.
“Government agencies used to be content to just get the message out. Now they care about persuasion,” said Mr. Ma, who teaches at an academy that trains party officials. “Not only do they want people to see their messages, they want to make you believe the messages are true and to inform your judgment. This is a major difference.”
The party’s best propagandists, he said, are students of politics and popular culture. Some have analyzed hit songs to learn how to use musical repetition to convey key ideas. Others have looked for inspiration in the speaking style of leaders like President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
Mr. Ma said he had sought to humanize Mr. Xi by depicting him and his wife, Peng Liyuan, as animated characters, a technique aimed at attracting people who are not interested in politics. He has also tried to make political topics more appealing by using vivid imagery, producing animations that depict officials scheming at bathhouses to promote Mr. Xi’s anticorruption campaign, for example.
The results have not been conclusive. While some of these propaganda videos have gone viral, others have been passed around only to be ridiculed. Few are able to summon the audiences drawn to China’s most popular movies, television shows and songs.
Rao Jin, a technology entrepreneur who runs a nationalistic website and media company known as 
, has tried to take a more substantive approach, starting a series of online talks in the style of TED events.
The subjects range from the colonialist history of foreign powers to China’s stability compared with the United States and Europe, and each video is aimed to appeal to younger audiences, using a conversational tone, sleek graphics and a minimalist set featuring a leather sofa.
Some talks, including one by a political commentator on how to 
, have been viewed tens of millions of times. “A lot of Chinese people blindly worship everything foreign,” said Mr. Rao, 31, who finances the project through commercial video work and profits from his tech firm. “We want young people to have more confidence in their own culture and in their nation.”
Mr. Rao is also working with the Communist Youth League and a rap group known as CD REV to produce music videos that denounce negative foreign media coverage of China and present the country as peace-loving and prosperous.
“All we hear is, ‘China is poor, it’s a dragon, it will eat us, it will beat us,’” Li Yijie, 22, a singer and lyricist for the group, said during a recording session in Chengdu. “We want to show people that China is not evil.”
Three of the four members of CD REV, who wear ripped jeans and gold watches, were raised by parents who served in the People’s Liberation Army. But Mr. Li said the group found inspiration in the anti-establishment music of hip-hop masters like Eminem and Dr. Dre.
The group has recorded a half-dozen patriotic music videos, most of them in English, featuring songs about China’s 
 and Mao’s legacy. In one about American attempts to spread democracy, it sings:
 have been viewed millions of times, thanks in part to the support of the Communist Youth League and state news outlets. Others have had only mild success.
Mr. Li said the group saw itself as filling a void where traditional propaganda had fallen short.

" announced on Friday that it was banning all commerce in ivory by the end of 2017, a move that would shut down the world’s largest ivory market and could deal a critical blow to the practice of elephant poaching in Africa.
The 
 follows years of growing international and domestic pressure and gives wildlife protection advocates hope that the threatened extinction of certain elephant populations in Africa can be averted.
“
’s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation,” Carter Roberts, the president and chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund, said in a written statement. “With the 
 earlier this year, two of the largest ivory markets have taken action that will reverberate around the world.”
According to some estimates, more than 100,000 elephants 
 in Africa over the past 10 years in a ruthless scramble for ivory driven by Chinese demand. Some Chinese investors call ivory “white gold,” while carvers and collectors call it the “organic gemstone.”
Elly Pepper, a wildlife advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is based in New York, 
 “may be the biggest sign of hope for elephants since the current poaching crisis began.”
Wildlife advocates have said for years that the most important step in putting poachers out of business would be shutting down the ivory industry in China.
The advocates have promoted long-running public campaigns to shame China and raise questions about its global responsibilities, at a time when China has been assuming a higher profile on the world stage. But the success of the new policy depends on how strictly it is enforced.
Wildlife researchers estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of all smuggled elephant ivory — maybe even more — ends up in China, where there are countless ivory workshops and showrooms.
In the announcement, the State Council, China’s cabinet, said the shutdown of the market, which includes all processing and sales, would occur in phases throughout 2017.
In the first step, a designated group of legal ivory processing factories and businesses will be forced to close by March 31. The Ministry of Culture will assist in the transition of legal ivory into use in museums and other cultural sites, as well as help workers in the industry, including master carvers, find related jobs.
Under the new rules, people who already own ivory products can keep them or give them as gifts, and owners can sell them at supervised auctions after getting official approval. But conservationists believe that the Chinese government is sincere in not allowing any significant domestic ivory market.
“Ivory traffickers have just lost one of their biggest markets,” said Aili Kang, the Asia executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society.
China’s move is at least partly a result of negotiations at senior levels between Washington and Beijing. In 2015, when President Xi Jinping of China made a state visit to Washington, he and President Obama 
 “nearly complete bans on ivory import and export” and “take significant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory.”
Those goals were reiterated this past June in Beijing during a summit meeting between the United States and China that addressed economic and strategic issues.
A 
 from that meeting noted that China enacted a ban on ivory imports and related products in March 2016 and that it would publish by the end of 2016 a timetable for ending its domestic commercial trade. Even with the import ban, smuggling continues as long as a domestic market exists.
“Demand for elephant ivory has skyrocketed in recent years, spurring poaching levels that are driving elephants towards extinction,” Ms. Pepper wrote Friday. “And ending the legal ivory trade in China — the world’s largest consumer of elephant ivory — is critical to saving the species.”
Illegal ivory ends up on the legal market after being smuggled into the country, chiefly by criminal syndicates. Hong Kong has been a main transit point.
Corruption and chaos in many parts of Central Africa, where the last great elephant herds roam, are fueling the trafficking. Poachers and rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Chad and South Sudan have exploited conflicts and a breakdown in order to massacre thousands of elephants, often using the proceeds from ivory to buy more weapons. Like blood diamonds in West Africa in the late 1990s, ivory has become Africa’s new conflict resource.
Scientists say that for the first time in years, more elephants are being killed than born, with the 
.
Tusks are often sold to African middlemen who pay off corrupt government officials either to look the other way or to take part in the smuggling themselves. Mombasa, Kenya, is one of the most notorious ivory ports.
Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the founder of Save the Elephants, a wildlife advocacy group in Africa, has been working for years to turn China against the ivory trade. “China is moving from being the main problem to the main solution,” he said, calling Friday’s announcement “the most astonishing and wonderful piece of news.”
Ms. Pepper of the Natural Resources Defense Council urged other nations, including Britain, to follow China’s lead, and said the United States, which has made significant progress on the issue, could do more to bolster enforcement.
The question of enforcement is one that will apply to China, too, as it enacts the ban, and government actions will be closely watched by conservationists and advocates. Chinese officials often announce ambitious policies but sometimes fall short on carrying them out. This is true of many environmental protection and conservation policies.
Pressure on the Chinese government over the ivory trade has come not just from international organizations. One of the most recognizable Chinese public figures, Yao Ming, the 7-foot-6 former Houston Rockets center, 
 as his main cause and has denounced the domestic trade in elephant ivory, rhino horns and shark fins. Years ago, he lent his name to billboards in Chinese cities that showed horrific piles of tusks. He has visited Kenya and helped publish a book on the issue and appeared in a 2014 documentary, “The End of the Wild,” made with the group WildAid.
Grace Ge Gabriel, the Asia director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, wrote on Friday that she was 
 at China’s announcement. She said the legal market in China had long provided cover for the illegal market, and it had also sent “a confusing message to consumers that it is O.K. to buy ivory.”
But the new policy, she said, “demonstrates the Chinese government’s determination to save elephants.”
Once the Chinese market shuts down, the main international market for ivory may shift to Southeast Asia, but the demand in that region is not expected to be nearly as large as in China, which, with 1.4 billion people, is the world’s most populous nation.","China Bans Its Ivory Trade, Moving Against Elephant Poaching","DEC. 30, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/world/asia/china-ivory-ban-elephants.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EDWARD WONG
"BEIJING — President Tsai Ing-wen of 
 sharply criticized 
’s leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island.
“Step by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,” she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a year-end 
.
Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai 
 with the American president-elect, 
, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice.
In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, 
 through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that 
, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan.
Despite Beijing’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation.
“We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said.
Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides.
But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The president-elect has also questioned the 
, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized China’s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea.
Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai’s words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China’s show of strength.
“She remains calm, rational and patient,” Ms. Glaser wrote in an email.
Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months.
Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai’s preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump’s bombastic style.
Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to “maintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics.”
Ms. Tsai’s vision, however, “may not align well with the incoming Trump administration’s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,” he said.
Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January.
 on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan.
Ms. Tsai described the visit as “unofficial,” saying, “A transit stop is just a transit stop.”",Taiwan’s President Accuses China of Renewed Intimidation,"DEC. 31, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/asia/taiwan-china-tsai-ing-wen-trump.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JAVIER C.

"NAIROBI, Kenya — In the past 10 years, tens of thousands of elephants have been slaughtered across Africa to feed 
’s insatiable appetite for ivory. Entire herds from Gabon to Tanzania have disappeared. 
. Scientists have said that the very survival of the species is in China’s hands.
On Friday, after years of denying that China was part of the problem, the 
: It would shut down the country’s ivory market, the world’s largest.
Will this save the elephants? This is what experts on the plight of elephants say:
• It all depends on the price. If China simply shuts down its legal ivory trade but does little to combat the much bigger illegal trade, then the price of ivory (now about $500 a pound) will stay high, giving poachers an incentive to keep killing.
• Making all ivory illegal in China could actually push the price up, like illegal drugs.
• Neighboring markets will be crucial. If Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines and others do not take similar steps, then many Chinese will simply buy their ivory from other places, which will keep demand high.
• African elephants face other threats, including habitat destruction and increasingly deadly contact with humans. 
.
• Many elephants are also hunted for bush meat. China’s new policy will not affect that.
• If the Chinese government really commits to combating the ivory trade, then the price of ivory could collapse. Criminal organizations and poachers will then abandon the business, and Africa’s elephant herds could recover for the first time in years.
Ivory comes from an elephant’s tusks, the equivalent of its incisor teeth. Ivory has been coveted for thousands of years because it is strong, beautiful and relatively easy to carve.
In the 19th century, European nations used ivory for billiard balls, piano keys, buttons, snuffboxes and false teeth. Countless elephants in central Africa were shot down. Joseph Conrad thinly fictionalized the ruthless scramble for ivory in “Heart of Darkness.”
Scientists believe that before the 19th-century ivory craze, more than 10 million elephants roamed the earth. Today, there are about 500,000.
Around 2002, conservationists across Africa started noticing the same thing: a growing proportion of dead elephants with their faces sawed off and tusks missing. At the same time, China’s economy was beginning to boom. In China, ivory is a status symbol, carved into bracelets, bookmarks, shot glasses, statuettes, chopsticks, combs and many other objects. As China’s middle class grew to the hundreds of millions, a new scramble for ivory intensified.
The ivory trade has been abetted by pervasive corruption, extreme poverty and the presence of armed groups in many areas of Africa where the last great elephant herds roam.
Elephants are killed many ways. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, they have been shot by poachers from helicopters. In Kenya, bows and arrows are often used, a quieter method that attracts less attention. In Malawi, poisoned pumpkins are rolled into the road for the elephants to eat. The poachers include subsistence hunters, rebel groups and even American-allied African militaries.
And the threat is not just to elephants. In recent years, 
.
Criminal gangs buy the ivory from poachers and ship it to Asia, bribing government officials along the way. The ivory is sometimes packed with anchovies or chili peppers, to throw off the sniffer dogs used by customs agents and law enforcement officials.
Wildlife researchers estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of all smuggled elephant ivory — maybe even more — ends up in China, where there are countless ivory workshops and showrooms, many perfectly legal.
In China right now, large pieces of legal ivory come with documents certifying that the ivory was acquired before the 1989 worldwide ban on the commercial ivory trade or that it came from one of the 
 since then, when a few African countries were allowed to sell from their stockpiles.
But many wildlife experts say this system is a farce. The ivory papers can be easily forged, and the ivory in public shops is often smuggled ivory from recently killed elephants that has been illegally imported and fraudulently labeled.
Iain Douglas-Hamilton, one of the world’s most renowned elephant researchers, said that up until a few years ago, Chinese officials denied that their country was a part of the ivory problem.
“It was a topic you couldn’t bring up with them,” Mr. Douglas-Hamilton said.
But over the years, he said, China has grown embarrassed by the criticism it has received around the world for its appetite for ivory. Wildlife groups, the American government, African governments and international movie stars have harangued China to say no to ivory.
“China has come through an extraordinary evolution,” Mr. Douglas-Hamilton said.
China says it will shut down its ivory trade by the end of 2017. It says it will start by closing the legal ivory processing factories.
But will this simply drive the trade underground? For instance, it is forbidden in China to traffic in tiger parts.
But there is still a thriving underground trade in tiger bones, used to make very expensive wines cherished for their supposed medicinal powers.
Some consumers seem to get an additional thrill from knowing tiger-bone wine is highly illegal.
Karl Ammann, a documentary filmmaker and independent wildlife investigator in Kenya, said he was worried that something like this could happen to ivory.
Ivory’s value as a status symbol could actually increase, he said, if ivory is seen as a statement of being above the law.
“If it’s illegal, that might make it even more attractive,” he said.
Mr. Ammann also said that many ivory-carving factories had already moved to Vietnam. On a recent trip to Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital, he said, he visited an ivory workshop that used a computerized machine that carved five ivory pieces at once.
The reaction among many wildlife experts in Africa can be summed up in one word: cautious.
“Assuming they are able to break the market, for us it does offer a bit of light at the end of a very dark tunnel,” said Emmanuel de Merode, the director of Virunga National Park in Congo.
But he quickly added: “Ivory can be stockpiled. Some people may think it’s worth trying to get more ivory in case the market opens one day.”
That could mean an increase in poaching before China’s ban takes effect.
Paula Kahumbu, the chief executive of WildlifeDirect, a conservation group in Kenya, said she was “suspicious” about China’s motives and its commitment to fight the ivory trade.
“China needs Africa right now,” she said. “I think they’re just buying good will.”
Ms. Kahumbu cited several Chinese infrastructure projects that had caused problems for Kenya’s wildlife.
When it comes to Africa, she said, China does not have “an environmental bone” in its body.",Closing China’s Ivory Market: Will It Save Elephants?,"DEC. 31, 2016",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/africa/africa-ivory-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

"MISSISSAUGA, Ontario — When the restaurant elevator doors opened onto a crowd of people, many holding video cameras, Kevin and Julia Garratt thought they had stumbled into a wedding party.
But this was no celebration. In a flash, the Garratts were snatched by men and shoved into separate cars. They would not see each other for more than two years.
On the night of Aug. 4, 2014, the Garratts, Canadian Christian aid workers who lived in the northeastern Chinese city of Dandong, did not know they were in the hands of 
’s feared Ministry of State Security. The men drove Ms. Garratt, 55, to an office building and demanded that she sign a document stating that she agreed to be investigated.
“Investigated for what?” she asked. It was only after a translator said the words “suspect” and “spy” that she understood. In another room, her husband was hearing the same chilling accusations.
Scared and bewildered, the Garratts signed. “I seriously thought they would realize they’d made a mistake, they’d say sorry, and we’d go home,” she said.
The Garratts gave their account of their arrest and detention in an interview on Dec. 12, nearly 
.
The Garratts suspect they were unwitting pawns in a gambit by the Chinese government to prevent 
 from extraditing a Chinese spy to the United States. The 
 transfixed Canada and proved deeply damaging to the country’s relations with China.
The couple’s account provides a rare glimpse into the workings of China’s opaque state security system. Their interrogations may also reveal clues about the vast reach of China’s global espionage network and the lengths to which the Chinese government will go to protect it. During the couple’s monthslong detention, for example, they said, they were frequently threatened with execution or told that they would be sent to a North Korean gulag.
At a time of Ottawa’s warming relations with Beijing, the Garratts’ experience highlights the risks Canada and other nations face in engaging with China. Though they are now back in Canada, the Garratts say they do not feel entirely safe, describing a series of unnerving incidents suggesting that the Chinese government may be trying to keep tabs on them and their relatives.
“Even now we live under a cloud,” said Mr. Garratt, 56.
Until their highly publicized detention, the Garratts’ only claim to fame was owning Dandong’s top-rated destination on TripAdvisor: Peter’s Coffee House. They lived in China on and off for 30 years, raising their four children there and moving the family from Vancouver to Dandong, a gritty city on the North Korean border, in 2007. Mr. Garratt said he had wanted to address the suffering of those living across the border by providing aid to orphanages and a school for the disabled in North Korea.
Peter’s Coffee House, named for one of their sons, quickly became a hub for expatriates, local Chinese curious about the outside world — and state security agents suspicious of the Garratts and their customers, who included the occasional American or Canadian diplomat.
Ms. Garratt taught international trade and management at a local university while her husband ran the cafe, organizing weekly “English Corner” language exchanges. In their spare time, the couple volunteered around Dandong, often taking Chinese orphans ice skating.
One evening, the Garratts were invited to a restaurant dinner by Chinese acquaintances who told them that they wanted advice about how their daughter could apply to the University of Toronto.
But the dinner, along with its aftermath upon the couple’s emergence from the restaurant’s elevator, was a trap: The setup had been put in motion by the arrest, six weeks earlier in Vancouver, of Su Bin, a Chinese aviation entrepreneur whom the United States had accused of 
.
Those supporting the Garratts say the couple were simply chess pieces in a larger geopolitical skirmish.
“The Chinese made it clear that the Garratt case was designed to pressure Canada to block Su Bin’s extradition to the U.S.,” said James Zimmerman, an American lawyer in Beijing hired by the family to lobby Canadian and Chinese government officials for their release.
In an emailed statement about the Garratts’ detention, Global Affairs Canada, the department that handles Canada’s diplomatic relations, declined to comment on the question of an exchange, but said, “Senior government officials were raising the case at every opportunity.”
The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa denied that the Garratts’ detention was linked to Mr. Su. “We don’t think it is related to any other cases,” an embassy spokesman said in an email.
According to the Garratts’ account, after signing the investigation document Mr. Garratt was driven to the couple’s apartment, where agents ransacked their possessions, grilled him about the contents of the kitchen cabinets and then carted off schoolbooks and computers in the family’s suitcases. After a heated exchange, the men allowed Mr. Garratt to take a pair of Bibles back to the detention center.
His wife was already at the compound, an extralegal detention center on the outskirts of the city, confined to a separate isolation cell that had a couch, a bed and a small window covered in opaque plastic. During the next six months, they said, they never knew the other was there.
But neither was ever alone.
Rotating pairs of guards sat on the couch in each of their cells, staring silently at them and writing down their every move. Harsh lights remained on 24 hours a day. To stay sane, Ms. Garratt said, she prayed, read books provided by the Canadian Consulate and each day drew a cryptic picture of something she was grateful for in the back of her Bible, afraid anything written would be confiscated.
They each faced daily six-hour interrogations by a team of three men. Armed with years of emails, Skype messages and surveillance records, the interrogators accused the Garratts of “hosting” foreign diplomats at their coffee shop, taking orders from Canada’s intelligence agency and stealing state secrets, the couple said.
The agents showed them photos of United States and Canadian diplomats who had visited their coffee shop. The interrogators claimed Mr. Garratt’s photos of street scenes in Dandong and views of North Korea across the Yalu River were espionage, even though tourists on riverboat trips took the same photos every day.
Ms. Garratt was forced to write confessions detailing her every conversation with embassy officials, a difficult task considering she had spoken to many foreign customers and did not know who they were. They also made her list the names, relationships and phone numbers of people in China and Canada she had emailed, going back more than a decade.
“When they pushed really hard, they’d threaten to take my son,” she said, referring to Peter, who was studying at a university in China at the time.
Security officers used a variety of coercion tactics. “They threatened execution many times,” Mr. Garratt said with a shudder. In one exchange, the interrogators described a 2009 meeting in Vancouver between the couple and an agent from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, who had wanted to ensure their volunteer work in North Korea was not violating United Nations sanctions. When Ms. Garratt asked how the interrogators had known about the meeting, one of them said, “We have people in the U.S., Canada, everywhere.”
Canadian officials declined to discuss the Garratts’ treatment, but the couple’s account squares with those of many people who have been in Chinese detention.
Their isolation ended as suddenly as it began. In February 2015, Ms. Garratt was released on bail and returned to their apartment. In the meantime, her husband was charged with espionage and transferred to a prison medical ward.
During the 19 months he spent there, a rumor circulated among the guards that he would be released as part of a prisoner exchange.
But in February, Mr. Su waived his challenge to extradition and cut a deal with the United States. Once that happened, “Beijing was stuck with a weak case of espionage against the Garratts and little bargaining leverage to get much of anything out of Ottawa,” said Mr. Zimmerman, the American lawyer.
In August, just days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada arrived in China for a Group of 20 summit meeting, Ms. Garratt was allowed to leave the country. Two weeks later, Mr. Garratt was taken to court, where a judge read out an eight-page guilty verdict in Chinese; the next morning, he was put on a plane bound for Tokyo, but only after agreeing to pay more than $14,000 in fines and signing a document promising not to speak with the news media about his detention. Much of that money, he said, had been dedicated to a North Korean orphanage.
Mr. Trudeau called while Mr. Garratt was en route to Vancouver, where the family tearfully reunited. Just days later, China and Canada agreed to discuss a landmark free trade deal and 
. The government has 
 that it made any concessions to China for Mr. Garratt’s release.
Yet the Garratts do not feel entirely free. In recent months, relatives have encountered strange interference on their phones, computers have gone haywire, and strange cars parked outside their homes drive away when someone approaches.
Most of all, the Garratts feel grief at losing the lives they built over 30 years. “That’s the sadness that overwhelms us,” Mr. Garratt said. “We were just trying to help people in need. That’s all we did.”","Couple Held in China Are Free, but ‘Even Now We Live Under a Cloud’","JAN. 1, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/world/canada/canadian-couple-china-detention.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,DAN LEVIN
"WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China, Mexico and other trading partners.
Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing, criticizing General Motors 
 for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. Hours later, Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said 
.
The choice of Robert Lighthizer (pronounced LIGHT-hi-zer) to be the United States’ trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump’s selection of top economic advisers and, taken together with the president-elect’s running commentary on Twitter, underscores Mr. Trump’s focus on making things in America. That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. Trump’s views on trade as 
, even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda.
Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth.
But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump. Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, 
, to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.
“We wanted him to know that we’ll work with him on doing that,” Mr. Trumka said. “I don’t think he has enough Republican support to do it, and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people.”
Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade, including Mr. Lighthizer, share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own self-interest. They argue that other countries are undermining America’s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy.
In picking Mr. Lighthizer, who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes, Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington’s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate.
“He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.
Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump, emphasizing, for example, the importance of enforcing trade rules, but they have not abandoned the party’s longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which will hold hearings on Mr. Lighthizer’s nomination, issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday.
“As the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we can’t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for American-made products and services,” Mr. Hatch said in a statement. “I look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob’s trade philosophy and priorities.”
Mr. Trump has named a number of advisers on trade, leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. The president-elect 
, an outspoken critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. Mr. Trump also said Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor and 
, will play a key role. Mr. Lighthizer, however, is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience.
“Those who say U.S.T.R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken,” said Alan Wolff, another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry’s co-counsel on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing Mr. Lighthizer’s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. “He’ll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro.”
There is also an ideological divide between the people Mr. Trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers, which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like 
, the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council; 
, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, tapped for secretary of state; and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, 
.
Proponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional Republicans, will exert a moderating influence.
“You’re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law,” said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White & Case. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement.”
Trade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of pro-trade policy.
“There’s going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade, and we’re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker,” Mr. Trumka said.
Mr. Trump’s promise to immediately designate China as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration’s intentions. Economists 
, although it has done so in the past. Mr. Lincicome said officially labeling China a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues.
A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta; the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations, but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports, but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation.
Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn.
“General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,” he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!”
General Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila, Mexico. American manufacturers are moving small-car production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States.
Ford’s announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of higher-priced vehicles, including its F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle.
“We are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,” said the company’s chief executive, Mark Fields.
Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration, when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices, setting the stage for a new round of confrontations.
Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade, but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded, like China in recent years, as a threat to American prosperity.
“President Reagan’s pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders,” Mr. Lighthizer 
 criticizing Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, for embracing “unbridled” free trade. Conservatives, he argued, “always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class.”","With Choice of Trade Negotiator, Trump Prepares to Confront Mexico and China","JAN. 3, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/us/politics/trump-robert-lighthizer-trade-mexico.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
"YAN’AN, China — In 1944, a group of American diplomats in a beat-up C-47 propeller plane swooped down onto a rocky runway in Yan’an. Their mission was to assess 
, who had made the city in northern 
 his guerrilla redoubt, and judge whether he deserved American backing.
Some of the Americans concluded that because Mao had the support of the people, he would have the upper hand in the inevitable civil war with Chiang Kai-shek, viewed by Washington as obstinate and corrupt. They were in favor of the United States throwing its weight behind Mao.
For that judgment, they saw their careers destroyed during the McCarthy era. They became victims of the witch hunt for so-called Communist sympathizers and those who “lost” China.
But to this day in Yan’an, they are heralded as the good Americans who understood China, and are even featured in a museum and compound here that eulogizes the Communist Party’s embattled origins and endurance.
One of the Americans, John Paton Davies Jr., jotted down his impressions of the city:
“Yenan — which we called Dixie since it was rebel territory — was from the air a thoroughly insignificant Northwest China town set in a treeless valley. The eroded, lumpish plateau that rose from the valley floor on either side was, in late October, parched bare and tan.”
Some of the others in the Dixie mission were also State Department China experts, like 
. Some were United States Army officers, like the mission’s leader, Col. David D. Barrett, a Chinese-speaking former military attaché.
In some respects, the old Communist Party stronghold has barely changed. The caves that the cadres used as hide-outs from Japanese bombers still exist, buried into the bleak hills like black eyes. The Yellow River remains a scrawny thread of water. The sense of isolation from the modern metropolises on the faraway coast persists. The food, stingy during wartime, remains surprisingly plain.
Yan’an is now a city of two million people, much of the progress coming on the back of oil and gas, and patriotic tourism designed to attract Chinese citizens curious about the Communist Party’s history. Senior cadres, dressed in black suits and chauffeured around in small vans, come to refresh their knowledge of the party’s early years under Mao, who fought both the Japanese and the Nationalist forces.
The museum, the Yan’an Revolution Memorial Hall, is a hulking edifice built 10 years ago that commemorates the Communist Party’s perseverance in the face of scarce food and diseases, like dysentery, that killed because of the lack of penicillin. The displays say nothing about the brutal ideological purges conducted by Mao and his secret police chief, Kang Sheng.
In one startling image of Service, who was born in China to American missionaries, he is dressed in work clothes, bending over to help a Chinese worker level rocks on the airport runway. Another shows Davies, dressed in a dark shirt and pants, standing in an official tableau with Mao, Zhou Enlai and other party officials.
The Americans called their living quarters the “dude ranch,” and Davies, also the son of American missionaries, describes in the memoir “China Hand” its eight rooms as dirt-floored, each with two beds fitted with straw mattresses. Heat came from charcoal braziers, and light from kerosene lamps.
The “ranch” has been rebuilt (brick flooring added) with wooden pillars in front, and with windows that in a touch of authenticity have glass only halfway up the wooden frames.
A few hundred yards away, a similar building marks the place where the border region military command was housed. A plaque notes that the command’s political commissar at the time was Xi Zhongxun, the father of the president of China, Xi Jinping.
The Americans had regular meetings, talking tactics and post-
 prospects, with Zhu De, the Communist commander in chief, who would later lead the forces to victory over Chiang’s Nationalists.
“The Dixie Mission had closer relations with senior Chinese military officers than any Americans have had with the Chinese Communists command before or since,” Richard Bernstein wrote in “China 1945,” his book about the period.
The Chinese were fascinated with the Americans’ luxuries: The soldiers each had several uniforms, they enjoyed canned food, and whenever they needed drugs, a plane would arrive with the supplies.
The Americans showed Hollywood movies in their cafeteria. The Chinese soldiers would peer in, shocked by the images of men and women kissing. “Vulgar taste,” Li Yaoyu, a Chinese veteran, later wrote of the movies. “We would leave, allowing these confusing Americans to watch on their own.”
Despite the outward bonhomie, an underlying thread of distrust gnawed at the relationship. When the civil war began in the fall of 1945, the Communists built a wall between the “dude ranch” and Xi’s building to protect secrets.
The Communists coveted the far more sophisticated American weapons. Li wrote how he and his colleagues had connived to steal an American rifle so they could copy it.
“We drove two American soldiers to a valley in an American jeep to find a Christmas tree,” he wrote. On the way back, the Chinese announced that the tree had to be delivered in the jeep immediately and that the Americans would have to walk back. Once the jeep returned to headquarters, the Chinese disassembled the rifle, and measured it, all in an effort to figure out how to make it.
Things fell apart when Mao, who had never been out of China, asked for a meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House.
“Mao wrote a letter asking the Dixie mission to deliver it to F.D.R., saying Mao and Zhou Enlai were willing to go to Washington,” said Zhao Hong, an associate professor of history at Yan’an University. “The letter was given to Wedemeyer, the commander of American forces in China, but it was not delivered to the president. The contact failed, and the Communists lost faith,” she said. (Ms. Zhao was referring to 
)
The museum ignores the ruined careers of the Americans who portrayed Mao in a positive light. Davies was fired in 1954 during a brief personal audience with the secretary of state, John Foster Dulles. Service was dismissed in 1952, though a Supreme Court decision reinstated him in 1957. John Carter Vincent, a diplomat who first proposed the Dixie mission to the United States government, was forced to leave the State Department in 1952.
Mr. Bernstein, in his book, called Davies and Service “smart and dedicated public servants” who were “naïvely dazzled” by the Communists.
Ms. Zhao, who has devoted her academic career to the Dixie mission, is not particularly critical of the American decision to stand by Chiang.
“The Americans were practical. They were looking after their own self-interest,” she said. “They wanted a pro-American government, and Chiang Kai-shek was easier to manipulate than the Communists.”
As for the men who supported the Communists but suffered for it, she said: “Service really understood China. After a long talk with Mao, he wrote that China would not be a replica of the United States, or a replica of the Soviet Union.”
He was right, she said.",‘Dixie Mission’ Americans Scorned for Backing Mao Are Hailed in China,"JAN. 1, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/world/asia/dixie-mission-americans-china-mao.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JANE PERLEZ
"BEIJING — 
’s vow to 
 by the end of this year was welcomed by environmentalists as a turning point in the fight against poachers. Activists cheered the government’s pledge for swift action, and the state-run news media called it a “monumental win for elephants.”
But in making the decision, announced on Friday, to bring 
 to a halt, the Chinese government also saw benefits for itself. The ban reinforced President 
’s campaign against corrupt officials, who have been known to use ivory products as bribes.
It galvanized support among African allies, which have long pressed Beijing to help curb poaching, as China looks to expand its influence on the continent.
And the decision allowed China to burnish its image as a global guardian of the environment, at a time when advocates have raised doubts about the ability of the United States to lead on environmental issues.
Peter Knights, the executive director of WildAid, which lobbied heavily on the ivory issue, said Chinese leaders had come to realize that taking action on environmental matters like 
 and illegal wildlife trade was essential to cementing China’s place as a global superpower.
“With power comes responsibility,” said Mr. Knights, whose organization has spent $3 million over the last four years on an advertising campaign in China against the ivory trade. “They know it’s not worth damaging China’s international image to be involved in this business.”
For years, Chinese leaders resisted taking strong action to curb ivory sales, convinced that conservationists were overstating the country’s role in fueling a trade that has, by some estimates, killed more than 100,000 elephants over the last decade. Ivory carving is considered a fine art and cultural tradition in China, and sales on the mainland have thrived for decades.
But attitudes among top leaders shifted over the last several years, advocates said, as a wave of 
 revealed the nefarious activities of Chinese smugglers and as evidence mounted that China’s economic boom had led to a surge in demand for ivory. (The stockpile of legal ivory in China is estimated at $150 million, according to advocates.)
Environmental activists in China, many of them affiliated with American organizations, including WildAid, led a concerted effort to raise awareness about the issue, investing in subway ads and television documentaries. Celebrities like 
, spoke out, urging the government to ban sales of commercial ivory.
Still, there were doubts among Chinese officials about the need for more forceful action, and some argued that the problem was not booming sales of ivory in China but lax enforcement in Africa.
“Their position was, ‘It’s not our problem, it’s the African countries’ problem, and we’re doing everything we can,’ ” said Susan Lieberman, the vice president for international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York.
But it became increasingly clear to Chinese officials that smugglers were bringing ivory into the country illegally and marketing it as a legal product. Ivory had become a status symbol among the rapidly growing middle class, used in products like necklaces and table lamps. Wealthy businessmen and officials were purchasing elaborate carvings as luxurious gifts or, in some cases, bribes.
In 2014, the Chinese ambassador to Tanzania, in an unusually public rebuke, 
 for “bad habits” and said officials worried constantly about people being arrested on suspicion of smuggling.
As China forged closer ties with African nations, its role in enabling the ivory trade provoked resentment, with some officials accusing Beijing of contributing to violence and terrorism in the region. It did not help that in 2014, reports emerged that 
 had, on a presidential visit to Tanzania the year before, bought thousands of pounds of poached tusks to take home.
“China became quite aware that even in their ‘legal market’ there was tremendous laundering through an illegal system,” Ms. Lieberman said. “They didn’t want to be the ones to blame.”
Chinese leaders seemed eager for a change. Officials burned stockpiles of ivory on the mainland before phalanxes of news cameras, and they began discussing the possibility of imposing a ban on ivory imports.
At the same time, the United States was pressing China to join forces to combat poaching, and in 2015, 
 and President Xi 
 to shut down the markets in their respective countries.
For Mr. Xi, who has pushed the idea of 
 in response to severe air, water and soil pollution, the idea of closing the domestic market brought several advantages.
It dovetailed with the president’s 
 against 
, who have traded exotic wildlife in money-laundering and graft schemes. It also allowed China a chance to show compassion toward allies in Africa, a continent whose oil, gas and copper reserves it is increasingly dependent on.
“It’s a good image-enhancing exercise,” said Martyn Davies, a managing director for Deloitte in Johannesburg who specializes in emerging markets. “People are looking for a visible clampdown in China and results in terms of arrests and prosecutions.”
China’s eagerness to act, analysts say, also reflected a desire by the government to raise its profile on environmental issues. China has already emerged as a global power broker on climate change.
Lin Li, a Chinese environmentalist who leads the Beijing offices of the conservation group WWF, said China seemed more willing to tackle international matters under Mr. Xi. “The top leaders are really looking to be environmental leaders,” she said. “They want to mobilize the masses, not just within China.”
Now China will be judged on how effectively it can carry out the ivory ban. Enforcement is a constant challenge in China’s legal system, and analysts expect some resistance, given the influence of the ivory industry.
Gao Yufang, a researcher at Yale University who has studied the ivory market in the country, said that while the ban represented progress, China would need to follow through with a holistic plan of action.
“The ivory trade is a great opportunity for China to show its commitment to its global responsibilities,” he wrote in an email. “It is necessary that we keep an eye on it to make sure China keeps its promise.”","In Banning Ivory Trade, China Saw Benefits for Itself, Too","JAN. 2, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/world/asia/china-ivory-ban-elephants.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JAVIER C.

"QINGYUAN, China — The 48 soccer fields of the vast 
 in south China seem barely enough for its 2,800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts, the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day, kicking, dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches.
“Soccer will be my career after I grow up,” Wang Kai, a gangly 13-year-old who has studied at the boarding school for over three years, said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. “I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo,” he said, referring to the Portuguese superstar.
Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China, where the country’s No. 1 fan, President Xi Jinping, is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power.
It is a moonshot for China, whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world.
In the last two weeks, the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts 
 to be worth as much as $40 million a year, the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year, but he declined, his agent 
.
These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. 
, the manager of England’s fabled Chelsea team, 
 the Chinese spending spree last month as a “danger for all teams in the world.”
The drive to match China’s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi’s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. “My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world’s best,” he 
 in 2015.
In the last two years, the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics.
It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men’s World Cup and returning the women’s team to its former glory.
That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players, Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs, hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise.
“Current spending has created massive expectations,” said 
, a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. “Spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons.”
But if soccer distills Mr. Xi’s national ambitions, it also illustrates how his plans could falter, as they have in other arenas, in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement, especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents, worried about their children taking precious time away from academics, as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent.
The pitfalls in fixing soccer, it turns out, are a bit like those in fixing the economy; a desire for quick, flashy success is putting long-term goals at risk.
People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party, 
 of a “bubble” of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations, while some clubs, officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players, 
.
“One of the biggest problems is short-termism,” said Cameron Wilson, a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits 
, a website that follows the sport in China. “There are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the grass-roots level in the provinces, it’s like people doing their own thing.”
China’s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national men’s team recently placed 83rd in 
, just ahead of the Faroe Islands, a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup.
The women’s team — the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades — has stumbled. It was runner-up for the Women’s World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest 
.
“The national team is a joke,” said Xu Yun, 16, who had come to Workers’ Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. “I think it will need decades to get it right. It’s not just a question of spending money, it’s attitude.”
For years, the domestic professional game was 
, brazen even by China’s hard-boiled standards. Since match-fixing revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009, the worst cheating has been cleaned up. “It still exists,” Mr. Wilson said. “Just not so blatantly.”
For Xi, soccer has been a passion since childhood.
His trips abroad have included photographs 
 and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012, he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at 
.
In September, he 
 in Beijing, where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game, according to memoirs of his former teacher.
“Look how healthy I am,” Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. “I laid the basis for that through sports when I was young.”
Private investors have piled into professional soccer, encouraged by Xi’s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government.
In the main pro trading season last year, the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players, outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million, 
, a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher.
But Mr. Xi’s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His 
 for 50,000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025, a leap from 5,000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70,000 by the end of 2020, from under 11,000. By then, the plan says, 50 million Chinese, including 30 million students, will regularly play soccer.
“Now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer,” said Dai Wei, the athletic director at r. Xi’s old school, the Bayi School. “That was unthinkable before.”
Yet there is deep cultural resistance, even at Bayi.
Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports, Mr. Dai said, because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams.
While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age, the country has not done as well at fostering group sports, where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity.
The privately run Evergrande school, the world’s biggest soccer boarding school, says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players.
“As more soccer schools are built, there’ll be more and more kids playing, and the stars will multiply, too,” said Liu Jiangnan, the principal of the school, which opened in 2012. “I’d guess that in seven or eight years, half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school.”
Drawn by such hopes, parents pay up to about $8,700 a year to send children here, where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships, and children from poorer families get discounts, school officials said.
But even here, the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts, and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics, said Sergio Zarco Diaz, a Spanish coach.
“The kids are getting better, year by year,” he said hopefully.
But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied.
Some schools, facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields, have devised their own drills, like 
, in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up, down and around. It may 
, but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game, said Zhang Lu, a widely respected soccer commentator.
“Chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing, recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. “The problem is that everyone’s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results, competition, training, creating stars.”
Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist, top-down approach, he argues.
Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon, the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields, shouting and squealing with delight.
“This morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog,” said the principal, Lin Yanling. “But at midday I notified the kids that it was back on, and they all went crazy with relief.”",President Xi’s Great Chinese Soccer Dream,"JAN. 4, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/world/asia/china-soccer-xi-jinping.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"SAN FRANCISCO — The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013.
The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where 
, and India, where the government 
 from circulation.
More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics — highlighted by Donald J. Trump’s election victory — has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight.
“The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,” said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities.
Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China.
Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their government’s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China.
But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators.
In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside.
The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify.
In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1,025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016.
The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoin’s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created.
The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1,150 on Monday.
The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors.
After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the 
, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself.
Some 
 on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses.
Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded.
Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the 
 website and its successors.
New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world.
Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement.
The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1,000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders.
The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low — under $200 — in early 2015.
Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network.
Many Bitcoin businesses have 
 to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have 
.
That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments.
But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions.
In November, 
 after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption.
The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has led to reports about 
 for Bitcoin.
But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a medium-size American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency.
That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher.
“I ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,” Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.","Bitcoin Price Soars, Fueled by Speculation and Global Currency Turmoil","JAN. 3, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-price-soars-fueled-by-speculation-and-global-currency-turmoil.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,NATHANIEL POPPER
"BEIJING — In what has been described as 
’s first case involving transgender discrimination in the workplace, a court in the southwestern province of Guizhou has ruled that the plaintiff was illegally fired but that there was no proof that his dismissal was a result of bias against transgender people.
“We found this a little bit of a shame,” Huang Sha, the lawyer for the plaintiff, a 28-year-old transgender man who has been identified in the state news media only as “Mr. C” and who has declined to provide his real name to protect his privacy, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. C, who was born a woman but says he has long considered himself a man, was dismissed from the Ciming Health Checkup Center in Guiyang, the provincial capital, in April 2015 after a one-week probation. In March 2016, Mr. C filed his case with a local labor arbitration committee asking for compensation and a written apology. Mr. C said in an interview in April that the company’s human resources manager had complained that he dressed like a gay man and looked too “unhealthy” to be an employee for a health checkup company.
In May, the arbitration committee 
 to pay Mr. C 402.30 renminbi, about $61 at the time, for the probation period, but rejected his demand for an additional month’s pay of 2,000 renminbi and an apology. He and Mr. Huang then brought the case to court.
The court held its first hearing in June but adjourned when Mr. Huang demanded an examination of two documents that the company had submitted as evidence that Mr. C had been fired for poor performance, failing to dress according to company standards and missing work.
The case resumed in December, after court-appointed experts from the Center of Forensic Science at the Southwest University of Political Science and Law concluded there was no way to authenticate the two documents, Mr. Huang said. The court’s ruling was issued on Dec. 30.
Mr. Huang said the court concluded that the company had failed to prove that it had fired Mr. C for reasons permitted as grounds for dismissal under labor law and ordered the company to pay Mr. C the 2,000 renminbi in compensation. But the court also said there was no proof that Mr. C’s termination had resulted from the company’s discriminatory attitude toward transgender people and did not grant Mr. C’s demand for an apology.
“This has demonstrated how low the cost of breaking the law is for employers,” Mr. Huang said, referring to the amount of compensation. “This is why the current job discrimination situation is so grim.”
“This case also highlights the problem of ‘invisible discrimination,’ because employers can always claim they fired people for reasons other than the one they’re accused of,” he said.
In recent years, there have been several high-profile lawsuits involving gender and sexual orientation, but most produced outcomes disappointing to activists. In September, a court in Beijing ruled against a

"BEIJING — 
’s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark, jibes and condemnation on Twitter: They banned access to it at home. Yet China has become the country that President-elect 
 seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his open-all-hours 
.
In bursts of 140 characters or less, he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan, trade, the

How and when President 
 reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump’s sarcasm — “Nice!” — could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the old-fashioned way, behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes.
Xinhua, the state news agency, has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. “An obsession with ‘Twitter foreign policy’ is undesirable,” read the headline of 
 on Tuesday about Mr. Trump’s posts.
“Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn’t child’s play, and even less is it like doing business deals,” said the article, published after Mr. Trump’s latest barbed comments on China.

But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump’s designated press secretary, Sean Spicer, has

“Issuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump,” Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump, it said, appeared to assume that “issuing hard-line comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries.”

"BEIJING — A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city’s mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday, injuring them before fleeing and killing himself, the official news media reported.
Privately owned guns are rare in China, because of a virtual ban on civilian use, and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon. So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua, an industrial city in Sichuan Province, rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news.
Panzhihua was built as part of Mao’s plans to relocate factories deep inland, where they would be protected from a feared war. But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China’s president, 
, to 
 into a clean, impeccably disciplined bureaucracy.
Details were sparse, and there were no clues to the gunman’s motives. But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau, Chen Zhongshu, bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there.
“The gunman stormed into the meeting, fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled,” said an 
 by Sichuan Daily, an official provincial newspaper, citing the Panzhihua government press office.
The suspect in the shooting, Mr. Chen, was found dead in the exhibition center. He had taken his own life, the report said without giving details. The mayor, Li Jianqin, and party secretary, 
, were wounded and sent to the hospital, but their injuries were not considered life-threatening, the report said.
Mr. Zhang, the party secretary, has worked in Panzhihua since 2006, and the mayor, Mr. Li, has worked there since last year, according to Chinese 
. Both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with Mr. Chen previously, but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing.

"HONG KONG — A time-lapse video of smog rolling into Beijing offers a jarring new perspective of the pollution that has been afflicting the Chinese capital in recent months.
The video, just 12 seconds long, shows what appears to be toxic smog descending on buildings over 20 minutes, with nearby structures becoming almost unrecognizable. The video was by taken by 
, a British worker, and posted on Monday, just as the city has been grappling with yet another extended bout of pollution.
Residents have come to expect such dense air pollution in the late fall and winter, as people burn coal to heat their homes. Recently, the problem has been particularly bad, and the city has been enveloped in smog for extended periods starting in October.
Mr. Pope, writing on Twitter, pegged the air quality index, a measure of the pollution, above 400 around the time of the video. The United States government rates readings of 301 to 500 as “hazardous.”
The environmental website 
 noted that the timing of the video coincided with 
 in readings for PM10, suspended particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter.
The past few weeks have been especially bad in Beijing. Officials declared a red alert for the city on Dec. 16, the 
 in a four-tier system, forcing older, high-emissions motor vehicles to stay off the road and schools to close. Hundreds of flights were canceled and highways were shut down because of low visibility.
Adding to the disruptions, the government on Tuesday issued its first-ever national red alert for fog, saying visibility would be as low as 50 meters, or about 160 feet, across northern China. And Xinhua, the state news agency, said the smog in Beijing was expected to last until a cold front arrives next week.
While China has taken steps in recent years to reduce the burning of fossil fuels that contribute to such smog, a combination of factors in Beijing, including weather patterns, vehicle exhaust and the city’s geographic position near mountains that trap emissions, have made progress tough.",Time-Lapse Video Shows Beijing Swamped by a Tide of Smog,"JAN. 3, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/world/asia/beijing-smog-video.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,GERRY MULLANY

", complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in 
 late last month.
The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times’s websites in 2012, after 
 on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the Chinese-language app.
Apple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store.
“For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,” Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. “As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.”
Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented.
China’s main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions.
The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision.
“The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,” Ms. Murphy said in a statement.
The request appears to have been made under 
 released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services.
The regulations say apps cannot “engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others.” The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish “prohibited” information.
The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world’s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of “harmful information” online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable.
Apple has previously 
 other, less prominent 
 
 from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them.
Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to 
 for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to 
 and the case was dropped.
Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents.
“Maybe in the end they have to do it, but I think there’s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,” Ms. Aslam said. “It’s not as simple as, ‘Because we operate in your jurisdiction, we’ll do anything you ask of us.’”
She added that it was “very worrying” that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government’s requests.
In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars 
 that the Chinese government provides to the world’s biggest 
 factory. China is also one of Apple’s largest iPhone markets, though 
.
On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apple’s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.
Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said.
In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a 
, The Times described an anti-Western internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices.
The Times news apps remain available in Apple’s app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China.
When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content.
But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government’s firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its Chinese-language app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop.
Apple’s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region’s app store.
The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had 
 and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation.
Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, 
 were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there.
Mark Natkin, the Beijing-based managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could “ever fully comprehend how challenging it’s going to be.”
Mr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that “the technology gap has started to close.”",Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China,"JAN. 4, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/media/new-york-times-apps-apple-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,KATIE BENNER

That is because Chinese authorities instructed 
 late last month to remove The New York Times news app from the Apple app store. As Katie Benner and Sui-Lee Wee 
, the move follows China’s 2012 blocking of The Times’s website. In 2012, the shutdown appeared to be the result of a series of reports in The Times on the extensive wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then China’s prime minister.
It is not clear why the app was removed. Apple would not even say what regulatory violation, if any, caused the removal; who in the Chinese government told Apple to do it; or whether any legal case had been made, or legal documents presented, before Apple acceded to China’s wishes.
The removal happened on Dec. 23. Earlier that day, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with Apple executives in conjunction with an 
 that would be published on Dec. 29 on the billions of dollars in perks and subsidies that China provides to the world’s largest 
 manufacturer, Foxconn, a manufacturing partner of Apple’s.
The move underlines the difficulty news organizations face in reporting on China, particularly when the country’s own people are also the readers.
Apple, which values China as both a manufacturing center and a consumer market, has in the past removed other news apps. Those of other major publishers remain available on the app store in China.
It is unclear whether Apple has ever resisted a Chinese order to remove an app, or otherwise broken with a request from the government.

The meeting on Sunday with Mr. Cruz, who lost to Mr. Trump in the Republican presidential primary contest, suggested that Ms. Tsai was looking to expand her ties to the Republican Party as it takes control of the White House and keeps its grip on Congress.
“I was honored to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan today,” Mr. Cruz said in a statement released after the meeting. “We discussed our mutual opportunity to upgrade the stature of our bilateral relations in a wide-ranging discussion that addressed arms sales, diplomatic exchanges and economic relations.”
Mr. Cruz added that members of Congress from the Houston area had received a “curious” letter from the Chinese Consulate requesting that they not meet with Ms. Tsai.
Ms. Tsai’s stop in Houston preceded visits to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, four of the 20 countries, along with the Vatican, that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan rather than

The United States does not maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan as a result of negotiations with Beijing that led to Washington’s recognition of the People’s Republic of China in 1979.
Under the “One China” policy, which underpins relations between China and the United States, Washington acknowledges that Beijing claims Taiwan while pledging to defend Taiwan from attack. The Communist Party of China has vowed to retake Taiwan, a democracy, by force if necessary.
 against making changes to the One China policy after he takes office on Jan. 20. The warning came in response to 
 between Ms. Tsai and Mr. Trump after his November election victory, the highest-level exchange between American and Taiwanese leaders since the end of diplomatic relations and one that has threatened to upend relations between Washington and Beijing.
For Ms. Tsai, it provided a potential opening with Mr. Trump’s party.
“Taiwan has maintained relations with China hawks in the Republican Party over the past several administrations,” said 
, a postdoctoral fellow at Academia Sinica in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. “Cruz is influential above and beyond many senators, given his performance in the last election campaign. It makes sense to add Cruz, whatever his relationship is going to be with the Trump administration.”
Echoing the defiant Twitter posts Mr. Trump issued after speaking with Ms. Tsai, Mr. Cruz bluntly refused to allow Beijing to set the terms of meetings between officials from the United States and Taiwan.
“The People’s Republic of China needs to understand that in America we make decisions about meeting with visitors for ourselves,” Mr. Cruz said. “This is about the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, an ally we are legally bound to defend. The Chinese do not give us veto power over those with whom they meet. We will continue to meet with anyone, including the Taiwanese, as we see fit.”
While American leaders have vowed to defend Taiwan from attack, the United States is not legally bound to do so, despite what Mr. Cruz said.
While in Texas, Ms. Tsai also met with Gov. Greg Abbott, with whom she discussed energy, trade and commerce. Reducing Taiwan’s economic reliance on China has been a major focus for the Tsai administration, which 
.
In the wake of the meetings, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said Beijing opposed any contact between Taiwan’s leader and “anyone from the U.S. government,” saying it threatens to hurt ties between Beijing and Washington.
A Chinese-language statement about Ms. Tsai’s time in Houston, released by Taiwan’s presidential office, did not mention the meetings with Mr. Cruz or Mr. Abbott, focusing instead on her attendance at a banquet for overseas Taiwanese.
At the event, Ms. Tsai said that her administration had been committed to deepening relations between Taiwan and the United States, according to the statement. “The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important ally and friend, and it occupies a special place in the hearts of the Taiwanese people,” it said.
Before leaving Houston, Ms. Tsai, speaking with reporters, said that her visits to the four Central American countries would “show the international society that Taiwan is a capable and responsible partner for cooperation.”
After her Central American tour, Ms. Tsai will pass through San Francisco on her return to Taiwan. On Saturday, Jessica Ditto, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said in an email to The Associated Press that neither Mr. Trump nor anyone on his transition team would be meeting with Ms. Tsai.
In June, Ms. Tsai met with Senator 
 in Miami en route to Panama, another country with diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
She has also previously met with 
, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff.
Mr. Rowen, the postdoctoral fellow, said that the visits were timely given Mr. Trump’s ascendance.
“In general, it raises Tsai’s national and international stature to be going on trips like this,” Mr. Rowen said. “There is, however, the potential for a shift in U.S.-Taiwan relations, so of course she’s going to seize the opportunity to meet with as many officials as possible.”","Taiwan’s President Meets With Ted Cruz in the U.S., and China Objects","JAN. 9, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/world/asia/taiwan-ted-cruz-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS HORTON
" intends to spend more than $360 billion through 2020 on renewable power sources like solar and wind, the government’s energy agency 
.
The country’s National Energy Administration laid out a plan to dominate one of the world’s fastest-growing industries, just at a time when the United States is set to take the opposite tack as 
, a climate-change doubter, prepares to assume the presidency.
The agency said in a statement that China would create more than 13 million jobs in the renewable energy sector by 2020, curb the growth of greenhouse gasses that contribute to 
 and reduce the amount of soot that in recent days has blanketed Beijing and other Chinese cities in a 
.
China surpassed the United States a decade ago as the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gasses, and now discharges about 
. For years, its 
 and coal industries prospered under powerful 
 and the growth-above-anything mantra of the ruling Communist Party.
The result was choking pollution and the growing recognition that China, many of whose biggest cities are on the coast, will be threatened by rising sea levels.
But even disregarding the threat of climate change, China’s announcement was a bold claim on leadership in the renewable energy industry, where Chinese companies, buoyed by a huge domestic market, are already among the world’s dominant players. Thanks in part to Chinese manufacturing, costs in the wind and solar industries are 
, making them increasingly competitive with power generation from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.
Sam Geall, executive editor of 
, an English- and Chinese-language website that focuses on the environment, said that the United States, by moving away from a focus on reducing carbon emissions, risked losing out to China in the race to lead the industry.
Mr. Trump has in the past called the theory of human-cased global warming 
 and picked a 
of President Obama’s rules to reduce carbon emissions, Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
The investment commitment made by the Chinese, combined with Mr. Trump’s moves, means jobs that would have been created in the United States may instead go to Chinese workers.
Even the headline-grabbing numbers on total investment and job creation may understate what is already happening on the ground in China. Greenpeace estimates that China installed an average of more than 
 in 2015, and covered the equivalent of one soccer field every hour with solar panels.
China may meet its 2020 goals for solar installation by 2018, said Lauri Myllyvirta, a research analyst at Greenpeace, who is based in Beijing.
But despite these impressive numbers, China’s push to clean its air and reduce its greenhouse gasses faces political pressure from the politically powerful coal industry.
Mr. Geall and Mr. Myllyvirta both said that Thursday’s announcement was missing any language on curtailment, or the amount of electricity generated by wind and solar that never finds its way to the country’s power grid. In China, wind power curtailment was 19 percent in the first nine months 2016, Mr. Myllyvirta said, 
 than in the United States, where curtailment levels are often negligible.
The main reason for curtailment, he said, is that China is plagued by overcapacity in electricity generation and operators of China’s grid often favor electricity generated from coal.
In recent years the country has also been building coal-fired power plants at a furious pace, although that has 
 along with China’s economy. Another omission from Thursday’s announcements, Mr. Myllyvirta said, was the absence of any specific target to reduce coal consumption.
But both Mr. Geall and Mr. Myllyvirta said Thursday’s announcement set the stage for still more power generation from renewable energy and a gradual shift away from coal.
“My experience with China is when a numeric target gets written down, it gets implemented,” Mr. Myllyvirta said. “It doesn’t always get implemented in the way you like, but it does get implemented.”",China Aims to Spend at Least $360 Billion on Renewable Energy by 2020,"JAN. 5, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/asia/china-renewable-energy-investment.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MICHAEL FORSYTHE
"HONG KONG — Global markets spent most of 2016 adjusting to the reality of a slow but steady weakening of China’s currency.
Now, Beijing appears uncomfortable with that state of affairs.
Financial regulators in recent days have introduced new rules to curb the amount of capital flowing out of the country, helping to slow the pace of the renminbi’s decline.
They issued stricter rules on the movement of renminbi offshore for conversion into dollars. Analysts also cited worries over reports that authorities were considering restrictions on companies as well.
The collective result: a temporary reverse in the slide of the Chinese currency’s value.
The effect has been most pronounced in Hong Kong, where investors trade a small pool of offshore renminbi more freely than in mainland China. After a two-day rally, the offshore renminbi rose as much as 2.5 percent, to 6.7853 against the dollar on Thursday, an exceptional gain for a currency that is usually subject to staid trading.
It has helped that the dollar has stumbled against major currencies. The currency has fallen in value after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting showed policy makers were concerned over uncertainty caused by the election of Donald J. Trump — in the minutes, Fed officials said they regarded both higher growth and lower growth as more likely since the election.
Beijing’s capital controls, and fears that more measures could be on the way, have tightened conditions in a city where the Chinese currency is already in short supply.
“China’s effort to curb capital outflow continues,” said Frances Cheung, head of rates strategy for Asia outside Japan at Société Générale. She added that “any restrictions that reduce the outflows” of China’s currency will further tighten the market for offshore renminbi.
Borrowing costs for offshore renminbi have been edging up for weeks on the interbank market, where lenders and other major financial institutions seek funding. By Thursday, that overnight deposit rate briefly rose as high as 100 percent. By comparison, it hovered between 1 percent and 3 percent for most of October and November.
Some analysts said the sharp swings in offshore exchange rates and borrowing costs appeared to be engineered by the Chinese leadership, as a way to ease depreciation pressure on the renminbi and to discourage speculation — namely short-sellers, investors who bet on declines in the currency, often by using borrowed funds.
“Movements of this speed and magnitude have to be either official intervention or officially directed action by Beijing,” said 
, an associate professor of finance at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, China. “The purpose is to remove renminbi from offshore centers like Hong Kong, which had been continuing to be a factor placing downward pressure on the renminbi.”
The Chinese central bank, the People’s Bank of China, denied that it was behind recent movements in the offshore currency market.
In an emailed response to questions, the central bank’s press office said claims that it had directly or indirectly intervened in the offshore renminbi market in Hong Kong were “not true.” It declined to elaborate.
Some economists noted that the tight conditions in the offshore market were enough to set off the squeeze without the central bank having to intervene directly.
“Liquidity had been tight since September, and the market had widely expected tight liquidity conditions to continue,” said Becky Liu, the head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong.","China, Seeking to Stop Weakening of Currency, Issues Restrictions","JAN. 5, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/business/dealbook/china-currency-renminbi-yuan.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,NEIL GOUGH
"HONG KONG — Smog and corruption are among the problems that the Chinese government has vowed to combat.
Now another problem, which lies right under many tourists’ noses, is in the authorities’ cross hairs: unsightly toilets.
The 
, a government agency, announced a five-year 
 in December to enhance the country’s tourism industry, including a project to build, expand and renovate 100,000 toilets in scenic areas and along tourist routes. The plan complements a campaign to add 
 nationwide by late 2017.
The agency’s chairman, 
, has said that a failure to upgrade toilets could damage the reputation of 
’s tourism industry, which the United Nations said 
 from international visitors in 2015, second only to the United States.
China should “advance the toilet revolution with the help of science and technology,” 
 in November at a conference in Beijing.
To help the revolution, the agency published a list of 10 scenic sites with exemplary toilets. The winner was 
, a resort complex of gray brick buildings with tiled roofs at the foot of the Great Wall on the outskirts of Beijing.
On a recent afternoon at Gubei Water Town, a visitor saw restrooms with sofas, potted plants and watercolor paintings. The urinals were exceptionally clean, and the stalls were stocked with what is often a rare commodity in China’s public facilities: toilet paper.
“One small step forward, one giant leap for civility,” a placard above each urinal said.
But the government is taking a hard line against stragglers. The tourism agency said in December that after recent inspections, it had 
 367 A-rated scenic sites for a range of violations, including outdated or unsanitary restrooms.
One place that the government penalized last year was the

 after inspectors conducted two undercover visits.

 at the time that the Shenlong Gorge was a “prominent laggard of the toilet revolution, with messy toilet sanitation, filthy conditions, seriously bad odors and dirty toilet appliances.”
In response, the site closed for five days in August, partly to renovate its 12 restrooms and add soap and toilet paper dispensers. But as of this week, it was still unaccredited.
The number of visitors to Shenlong Gorge has slumped, and the management recently dropped the entrance fee to 80 renminbi, about $12, from 100 renminbi, said Liao Jiangwei, Shenlong’s general manager. He said that he was working to improve the site’s restrooms but that some of the government’s standards appeared to be subjective.

"BEIJING — For millions of Chinese, the new year opened under an oppressive shroud of smog that has closed highways, delayed or canceled hundreds of flights and shut down schools, forcing some students to follow their lessons from home through online streaming.
The toxic air has also drawn attention to a poem written by a Chinese surgeon from the viewpoint of an ambitious lung 
 that revels in the “delicious mist and haze.” The poem was first 
 in the October issue of Chest, the journal of the American College of Chest Physicians, under the title “

 as making a direct link. “The intense rise in lung cancer,” he said, “is intimately related to smog.”
Dr. Zhao has long written poetry as a pastime. But in 2015, while a visiting scholar at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and at Washington University in St. Louis, he heard that some academic journals published poetry. Last year, he submitted his poem to Chest, which ran it in its October issue.
“As a thoracic surgeon, I have diagnosed many patients with ground-glass opacity adenocarcinoma in my regular clinical practice,” he said in an telephone interview, referring to tumors. “I hope this poem will help more people understand it and take it seriously.”
As for why the poem was told from a cancer’s perspective, Dr. Zhao said he was inspired by reading science fiction.
“I think everything in this world has consciousness and determination,” he said.
“Sometimes when I look at the scan images and see the shadows of G.G.O., I can feel it growing stronger with a will and a tribe of its own,” he added, referring to ground-glass opacity. “So I thought, why not write down what the G.G.O. and cancer would be thinking?”
Dr. Zhao said that in his surgical practice he has noticed more and more nonsmokers who have developed lung cancer.
“Most of the female lung cancer patients are nonsmokers,” he said. “Some are little girls. I even had a 9-year-old patient, a little girl, and we had to cut out part of her lung. I’ll never forget her.”
“But I am confident about the government’s determination” to tackle air pollution, he added.

"Rogue trappers and poachers. An imperial court battling corruption. Border guards defending a giant wall and patrolling a vast wilderness beyond.
This is not “Game of Thrones,” but “
,” a new book by the historian 
 that analyzes the complex relationships among the exploitation of natural resources, environmental regulation and ethnic identity under the ruling Manchus of the Qing dynasty, 
’s last.
Mr. Schlesinger, a scholar of imperial China at Indiana University in Bloomington, studied Manchurian and Mongolian archives to track the trade in furs, pearls and mushrooms across the Qing empire’s borderlands in the 18th and 19th centuries. He writes that Qing rulers created protected areas and limited harvests in response to environmental degradation and to reflect imperial politics that linked Manchu and Mongolian identity with a romanticized vision of unspoiled nature.
“The empire did not preserve nature in its borderlands; it invented it,” Mr. Schlesinger writes in the introduction. “The book documents the history of this invention and explores the environmental pressures and institutional frameworks that informed it.” In an interview, he discussed how Qing officials managed natural resources, their influence on conservation in contemporary China and the parallels between early conservation policies in China and the West.
The Qing court actually never quite settled on a single approach. Instead, its responses depended on the locality and the resource. In some cases, as with timber production in 
, the court endorsed a licensing plan that could better control and capitalize on trade. In other cases, the court took the opposite approach and banned production altogether, as during Mongolia’s rush for wild mushrooms, when the court feared widespread poaching and undocumented migration were destroying the environment and Mongol way of life.
Many historians argue that Chinese statecraft embraced a more pro-development attitude towards resource exploitation in these years. The real story is a bit more complicated. Preservationist policies often won out.
Yes, I think, but with caveats. There are some important differences between Qing environmental thought and our own. Qing subjects aimed to save their empire and its constituent parts, not the planet. They never justified their positions in terms of the sciences. They also lacked any umbrella organization or agency dedicated to managing the environment. In all of these respects, there are significant differences between modern environmentalism and what was practiced in the Qing world.
That said, I do think, and try to show in the book, that many of the practices and concepts that were operative in the Qing — for example, the ways the court organized policies around “purity” in Mongolia and the idea of “nurturing the mussels” in Manchuria — were in many ways congruent with what you see in other parts of the world in the 19th century. In the Qing, ethnic identity profoundly informed environmental politics, and Qing officials justified environmental protection in part as a way of defending the Manchu and Mongol homelands — just as many in the German-speaking world saw nature protection as a pathway to redemption for the German “Volk,” and Americans called for national parks to preserve the country’s national spirit. This powerful connection between identity and environment is not unique to modern Western environmentalism. It has a more complicated past.
Sometimes it’s easy to think that the environmental history of the West is the standard by which we should measure environmental histories of other places, and I just don’t think that’s the appropriate method for understanding the history of the Qing empire. Now, I do think there are fruitful comparisons between what was going on in Europe or the Qing empire at the time. But I don’t necessarily think we should measure the Qing solely using terminology or models that we assume to be universal, but that in fact derive from and best describe European or American history.
One of the lessons is that there’s no place in China, or in countries around China, where there is unspoiled, pristine nature. If something appears to be unspoiled and pristine, chances are it’s because someone worked to make it that way at some point in time, and people have consistently worked to make it that way.
I think of 
. It’s this volcano on the border between North Korea and China, and the Manchus considered the lake inside the crater at the top to be holy territory. It was special because it was the birthplace of the Manchus. The court had special rules on collecting ginseng or trapping sable or other fur-bearing animals on the mountain. When British explorers first climbed the mountain in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they referred to it as untouched and unspoiled nature.
In fact, it was very much touched. People had been poaching on the land, but the court had been using its resources to protect that territory. The People’s Republic of China has converted this space into a

"BEIJING — Like ghosts floating in a dim netherworld, the dancers twirled, spun and curtsied in smog so dense that couples a few steps away seemed to be murky apparitions suspended in a gray haze. Filthy air has swamped much of northern 
 for weeks, but some amateur dancers have stuck to their outdoor ballroom routines.
The specterlike dancers in Fuyang, a city in Anhui Province, this week have become one of the images that capture China’s latest winter of smog. A wintertime surge in pollution here is often called an “airpocalypse” in foreign news reports. But as these images suggest, living in this miasma has become for many residents a 
, even defied with an outdoor fox trot.
“The scariest thing isn’t the smog, it’s how we’ve become numbed and used to it,” said one 
 on a Chinese news website, 
. Others shrugged off the bleakness with sardonic humor, as people here often do.
“There’s nothing scary,” said another comment on the same website. “Breathing fresh smog every day, I feel fortunate to be living in this magical country.”
Air pollution is chronic across much of industrialized China, but it worsens in winter, when coal-burning heaters fire up and add to the airborne grunge from factories and power plants. An uptick in heavy industry in 2016 has added to the haze this winter, some experts say. In the cold months, polluted air can accumulate across the region, sloshing from one part to another until strong gusts blow it away — until another pool accumulates. Smog extended from the port city of Tianjin deep into central China on Thursday.
On Tuesday in Fuyang, the air quality there was poor, but not terrible by the hard-bitten standards of many Chinese cities. The level of PM2.5 pollution, the fine particulates that pose the greatest danger to health, 
 283 micrograms per cubic meter, and the air was classified “severely polluted.”
But since December, levels across many cities in northern China have gone much higher, even reaching 1,000 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter last month 
, a city in Hebei Province. The World Health Organization 
 daily exposure of no more than 25 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter.
Many residents have become increasingly sensitive to the health threats from air pollution. Patience with the smog is wearing thin, especially among middle-class residents, who can afford to travel and experience life and breathing outside the dome of haze.
The government has promised to clean up the air, and indeed there have been improvements, especially throughout the summer last year. Yet that progress has made the return of the smog this winter even more jarring. Travelers returning by air to Beijing lately have descended from blue skies onto a Stygian underworld. For those trying to leave, many flights have been delayed or cancelled on the worst days because of the poor visibility.
What worries many people most is the risk to children and the elderly. This week, a letter in the name of Beijing parents urged the city government to allow schools and parents to buy fresh air equipment for classrooms. Officials said air filters would be 
 as a tryout, though not the bigger equipment the letter called for.
“We really don’t want to wait any longer!” said the letter, which circulated widely on the internet. “The smog won’t wait for us.”
Many people in Beijing and other affected Chinese cities now routinely wear masks — a novelty even a few years ago — although often they use cheap, flimsy cotton covers that do little to ward off PM2.5 particles.
“This winter was the first time I’ve thought about moving away,” said Lu Xin, a manager with an internet firm, breathing through a high-tech mask attached to its own electric air filter. “My 3-year-old boy and my parents cooped up at home every day, never going out.

All was going swimmingly until it began to drizzle, and then to pour, and before we knew it Toontown was flooded and cast members rushed through to evacuate us “backstage” to Fantasyland. It was a bummer, but also a perfect metaphor for 2016.

Do you get it?
: I don’t understand the question, and I 
 to it.
: Yeah, so Medium, the web’s favorite place for tech bros to tell us how they really feel about homeless people, laid off a third of its staff this week. The reason wasn’t that it was losing a bunch of money, according to the Medium post from its chief executive, Evan Williams. Instead, Williams says that the company wants to find some way to 
.
Yeah, him and the rest of the publishing industry.
At the moment, most online content is funded by advertising, and Medium had spent a lot of time creating new kinds of ad products. But Williams now says that creating slightly new ad stuff wasn’t a big enough plan. So he’s laying off 50 people and taking time to find some other business model. There’s only one problem: He has no idea what it is, yet.
 I feel like if you’re giving up on ads, there’s only two ways you can go with this. Tip jars and donations which, for new media start-ups that aren’t grant funded, doesn’t seem scalable. Or go the way of the subscription, which I believe in for some companies that have high value propositions (i.e. The New York Times) or longstanding brand equity (again, usually found in legacy institutions like The Times). Medium may have the former, but hardly has the latter. It’s hard to get to scale when you’re only a few years old, have a small staff and aren’t filled with consistently high-quality content.
: I think there was some schadenfreude among media people about his announcement, but I found myself agreeing with a lot of Williams’ position. He’s right: There’s a lot of terrible content being created online only because the business model demands it — because you get clicks and reshares by publishing it. If a rich guy is looking to figure out some better way, I’m all for it.
 I actually agree with you here. I think the media’s instinct is to be cynical, which is typically a good check to power for large institutions that deserve it.
While I’m hardly saying folks shouldn’t criticize Medium, I do think our industry likes to kick folks when they’re down for what is perceived as hubris, even if those companies were trying to build and improve upon what is clearly a model that won’t sustain the number of media companies currently out there.
That said, Ev’s “everything is terrible, but I don’t have a solution, I’ll just say it’s all bad” approach to that blog post turned a bunch of people off, including me. I guess we’ll watch for the company’s next act.

, in response to a request from the Chinese government. The Times’s website has been banned in China since 2012, and now, according to 
, the government contends that the apps are in violation of local regulations. But neither the government nor Apple will say what those regulations are.
Sounds about right. The timing of the removal is particularly interesting, given 
.
Sure, Apple has to comply with local laws, so its hands are likely tied. Also, obviously, you and I have a bias in this issue. But here’s what I wonder: Why doesn’t it raise a bigger outcry about this sort of censorship? When the F.B.I. asked Apple to unlock a terrorist’s iPhone last year, Apple didn’t just roll over and do it. It staked its entire corporate image on fighting the American government’s request using every available tool, including the courts and the public relations.
China is a big market. Apple can’t abandon it. But can’t Tim Cook come out and say, “This is censorship, and we’ll go kicking and screaming before we implement it?”
 Perhaps Apple just doesn’t want to pick a fight in this censorship versus journalism arena, which is certainly the company’s prerogative. It’s all odd to me.

"BEIJING — A few months after Lu Qiumei gave birth to her daughter in 2012, local officials visited her home and told her that she was required to be fitted with an intrauterine device.
For more than three decades, this was national policy in 
. The IUD was the government’s most important tool for limiting couples to one child, and almost all new mothers were required to get one.
Ms. Lu, a former advertising executive, considered the demand invasive, insulting and potentially harmful to her health. Still, like hundreds of millions of Chinese women before her, she made an appointment with a state gynecologist and had one put in.
Now, a year after abandoning 
, the government is hoping to make it up to Ms. Lu and millions of women like her — by removing their IUDs, free of charge. But the offer, made without even a hint of an apology, has provoked incredulous outrage.
“We shouldn’t even have had this in the first place, and now the government wants to use it as a form of state benefit for people,” Ms. Lu, 36, scoffed in a phone interview from her home in the 
. “It’s like they are slapping themselves in the face.”
While IUDs elsewhere can often be removed with the tug of their strings in a doctor’s office, surgery is usually needed in China because most devices here are designed or altered to be more difficult to extract, some with shortened strings and others with no strings at all.
But many Chinese women have chafed at the thought of the government’s getting involved, yet again, in their private lives. And for many mothers, the offer has come too late for them to consider having a second child.
“It’s the equivalent of someone injuring you and then mending the wound,” said Zhang Xintian, 25, who watched her mother go into surgery two years ago in the eastern province of Zhejiang to remove the IUD she had worn for more than two decades.
In China, women often have the same IUD from soon after childbirth until 
; while popular IUDs in the United States are typically deemed effective for up to 10 years, those used in China offer 
 for much longer.
China began demanding that women be fitted with an intrauterine device after they had one child, and sterilized after they had two, in the early 1980s. Those who refused risked that their children would be denied access to public schools and 
. Civil servants and state employees who refused lost their jobs.
From 1980 to 2014, according to official statistics, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with IUDs. And 107 million underwent tubal ligations or, as is commonly said, got their “tubes tied.” Local officials were evaluated by their ability to meet targets, leading some to order that the procedures — as well as abortions — be performed by force on women who resisted.
Then last year, confronting an aging population and a shrinking work force, President 
 relegated the one-child policy to the Communist Party’s scrap heap of discarded dogma. And without so much as an expression of regret or an admission that it had perhaps made a mistake, the party pivoted from punishing couples for having a second child to encouraging them to get on with 
.
To that end, an official said at a recent news conference that 18 million women would be eligible for the free removal of IUDs in the next three years so they could bear a second child.
“Our country provides support in terms of law, finance and service systems to ensure citizens’ access to the free removal of IUDs,” said the official, Song Li of the National Health and Family Planning Commission’s department of women and children.
But the head-spinning reversal, the paternalistic attitude, the failure to accept any culpability — for some, it was too much. Within hours of the news conference, the internet was fuming with indignation.
The mass implantation of IUDs amounted to “involuntary, forced acts of mutilation,” Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a post shared nearly 3,000 times on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “And now, to say they are offering free removal as a service to these tens of millions of women — repeatedly broadcasting this on state television as a kind of state benefit — they have no shame, second to none.”
Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the IUD, which is inserted into the uterus to block fertilization. In the novel “
,” by Mo Yan, the first Chinese citizen to win the 
 in Literature, the main character imposes a reign of terror involving the compulsory implantation of IUDs and tries to catch women who surreptitiously remove them.
In mainland China, being fitted with an IUD is called “shang huan,” a phrase that literally means “installing a loop,” referring to the low-cost, 
 that was the state’s preferred device for more than a decade despite higher rates of 
. The rings were replaced in the mid-1990s by safer and more effective IUDs.
According to gynecologists in China, IUDs used for Chinese women were meant to be left indefinitely, with surgery necessary to take them out.
Dr. Gloria Korta, a gynecologist at Winchester Physician Associates in Massachusetts, who toured Chinese hospitals as part of a cultural exchange in 2001, said that while there was a risk of infection from having an IUD implanted for many years, it was small.
Perhaps because of the problems associated with the early model, there remains widespread concern in China about the IUD’s impact on women’s health. In 2012, the online portal Tencent published 
 arguing that many Chinese women had “experienced serious damage to their mental and physical health” from the IUD campaign because of “rough surgeries and poor hygiene conditions.”
Ai Xiaoming, 63, a prominent documentary filmmaker, said many women, herself included, had never been advised of potential complications and the need for regular checkups after getting an IUD. She had to have a 
 when surgery to remove her IUD was botched.
“In the eyes of the government, women are labor units,” Ms. Ai said. “When the country needs you to give birth, you have to do so. And when they don’t need you to give birth, you don’t.”
Even before the end of the one-child policy, the government allowed some women to remove their IUDs if they complained of medical complications. Others, including Ms. Zhang’s mother, did it without permission, paying sympathetic doctors to remove them.
But Wang Feng, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the one-child policy, said the government appeared to be preparing to remove IUDs on a larger scale.
“They were anticipating the numbers, how many operations need to be done, as if this is another government program,” he said.
The government’s eagerness appears to be driven in part by growing concern over the economic impact of the nation’s 
, now one of the lowest in the world. According to 2015 data, Chinese women had 1.05 children on average, well below the population replacement rate of more than 2.1.
With fewer young people to support larger numbers of retirees in China, scholars have warned of a looming demographic crisis. But many couples are 
 in having a second child, some because of the potential costs, others because of their age.
Cao Cuihua, 35, a restaurant owner in the central province of Anhui and the mother of a 9-year-old boy, said she did not plan to remove her IUD because she and her husband could not afford more children.
“I did think about having a second child, but my economic circumstances don’t allow it,” she said. “This national policy to have two children has come a bit too late.”
Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies China’s demographics, said half of all Chinese women eligible to have a second child were 40 or older.
“Most people have already lost the ability to give birth,” Dr. Yi said by email. “The willingness to have children is already very low, so the Chinese government’s offer of free surgeries will be of no avail. It will have little effect on the birthrate.”
Mao Qun’an, a spokesman for China’s family planning commission, defended the offer to remove IUDs and said the government would also cover the costs of surgery to reverse tubal ligations and vasectomies. (Such procedures are more complicated, and critics say most Chinese hospitals are not equipped for them.)
Dr. Dalice Marriott, a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital, said a woman who had an IUD for a long time ran the risk of “having it embedded in the uterine wall.” “That makes it much more difficult to remove,” Dr. Marriott said, adding that the surgery could result in bleeding, infection and injury to the uterus.
Asked about the public outcry over the government’s offer to remove IUDs, Mr. Mao replied, “We did not deliberately emphasize that it’s a government benefit.”
Li Yinhe, a prominent Chinese scholar of sex and the family, defended the government’s approach, arguing that population control measures were “not targeted against women’s rights.”
“If the state doesn’t engage in this, then it’s not only a disadvantage for men, it also hurts the interests of women,” she said. “Women giving up their reproductive rights is a sacrifice that is made for the whole Chinese society.”
But many women want the government to acknowledge that its original policy was wrong. “What they’ve done to women is inhumane,” said Xu Dali, 35, a mother of two sons in Linyi. “Why did the government force every women then to have an IUD? At that time, why did it not consider the physical harm that has been inflicted on every woman?”","After One-Child Policy, Outrage at China’s Offer to Remove IUDs","JAN. 7, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/world/asia/after-one-child-policy-outrage-at-chinas-offer-to-remove-iuds.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,SUI-LEE WEE

"HONG KONG — McDonald’s said on Monday that it would sell its businesses in mainland China and Hong Kong for $2.08 billion to Citic, a state-owned conglomerate, and the 
, a 
 firm.
The deal gives Citic and Carlyle franchise rights for 20 years. Citic and its investment arm, Citic Capital, will have a controlling stake of 52 percent, while Carlyle will take 28 percent. McDonald’s will retain the remaining fifth of the company.
“China and Hong Kong represent an enormous growth opportunity for McDonald’s,” Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, said in a news release. “This new partnership will combine one of the world’s most powerful brands and our unparalleled quality standards with partners who have an unmatched understanding of the local markets.”
Mr. Easterbrook, who 
 and set about turning the company around, has seen it regain its financial footing recently, although growth has slowed.
The turnaround plan announced involved making 95 percent of its restaurants franchises, including more than 1,750 in China and Hong Kong. McDonald’s operates and franchises more than 2,400 restaurants in mainland China and more than 240 in Hong Kong.
McDonald’s opted for a franchise deal to save on investing and modernizing stores itself, according to Ben Cavender, a senior analyst at China Market Research, a consultancy based in Shanghai.
“At the end of the day they can make more money,” Mr. Cavender said before the announcement. “They can be more profitable if they are asset light and make money off franchise fees and leave the heavy lifting to somebody else.”
The consortium said it planned to focus on opening new restaurants in third- and fourth-tier cities. For Citic, the investment was seen as a way to tap into rising disposable incomes in China. Chang Zhenming, the chairman of Citic, said the deal was a “strategic opportunity for Citic to invest in the expanding Chinese consumer sector.”
If McDonald’s moved into smaller cities, there could be opportunities for growth, said Joel Silverstein, president of the consultancy East West Hospitality Group.
“McDonald’s definitely has much more developmental potential ahead of it compared to Yum,” Mr. Silverstein said ahead of the announcement, referring to the fast food group that owns KFC and Pizza Hut. “KFC has gone into Tier 3 or 4 cities, where McDonald’s hasn’t expanded nearly to that extent yet.”
In the 1990s, Chinese consumers flocked to Western fast-food chains, drawn to them by their clean bathrooms and air-conditioning — a novelty in China at that time. But since then, restaurants like McDonald’s and KFC have struggled against increasing competition from a boom in quick-service Chinese restaurant chains and a shift toward healthier eating.

Still, there was concern about how McDonald’s could expand and retain customers.
Chinese people are not “great burger eaters to the extent that they like fast food chicken,” Mr. Cavender at China Market Research said.",McDonald’s China Operations to Be Sold to Locally Led Consortium,"JAN. 9, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/business/dealbook/mcdonalds-china-citic-carlyle.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,AMIE TSANG
"On the night of Nov. 16, a group of executives gathered in a private dining room of the restaurant La Chine at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan. The table was laden with Chinese delicacies and $2,100 bottles of Château Lafite Rothschild. At one end sat Wu Xiaohui, the chairman of the Waldorf’s owner, Anbang Insurance Group, a 
 with estimated assets of $285 billion and an 
. Close by sat Jared Kushner, a major New York real estate investor whose father-in-law, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States.
It was a mutually auspicious moment.
Mr. Wu and Mr. Kushner — who is married to Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and is one of his closest advisers — were nearing agreement on a joint venture in Manhattan: the redevelopment of 666 Fifth Avenue, the fading crown jewel of the Kushner family real-estate empire. Anbang, which has close ties to the Chinese state, has seen its aggressive efforts to buy up hotels in the United States slowed amid concerns raised by Obama administration officials who review foreign investments for national security risk.
Now, according to two people with knowledge of the get-together, Mr. Wu toasted Mr. Trump and declared his desire to meet the president-elect, whose ascension, he was sure, would be good for global business.
Since the election, intense scrutiny has been trained on Mr. Trump’s company and the 
 he will face. But with Mr. Kushner laying the groundwork for his own White House role, the meeting at the Waldorf shines a light on his family’s multibillion-dollar business, Kushner Companies, and on the ethical thicket he would have to navigate while advising his father-in-law on policy that could affect his bottom line.
Unlike the 
, which has shifted its focus from acquisition to branding of the Trump name, the Kushner family business, led by Mr. Kushner, is a major real estate investor across the New York area and beyond. The company has participated in roughly $7 billion in acquisitions in the last decade, many of them backed by opaque foreign money, as well as financial institutions Mr. Kushner’s father-in-law will soon have a hand in regulating.
The Anbang talks, which have not previously been reported, began roughly six months ago — “Well before the president-elect’s victory,” Mr. Kushner’s spokeswoman, Risa Heller, noted. That was, however, just as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the talks are far along, representatives for Mr. Kushner said some points remained unresolved. Ms. Heller declined to outline the financial terms under discussion.
Mr. Kushner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has hired a leading Washington law firm, WilmerHale, to advise him on how to comply with federal ethics laws should he join the White House staff as an adviser to the president. The firm has concluded that one potential sticking point, a federal anti-nepotism law, is not applicable, though not all ethics experts agree. While the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead, Mr. Kushner’s lawyers argue, among other things, that the White House is not an agency and is therefore exempt.
As for conflicts of interest, Mr. Kushner would be required to make limited financial disclosures, which could give the public a clearer picture of his holdings. And, unlike Mr. Trump, who as president will be exempt from conflict-of-interest laws, he would have to recuse himself from decisions with a “direct and predictable effect” on his financial interests.
Jamie S. Gorelick, a WilmerHale partner who served in the Clinton administration, said that while plans were not final, Mr. Kushner was taking significant steps to extricate himself from the family business. “Mr. Kushner is committed to complying with federal ethics laws, and we have been consulting with the Office of Government Ethics regarding the steps he would take,” she said.
He will resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, and though the law does not require it, she said he would divest “substantial assets.” She did not name them, but Ms. Heller said they would include his stake in 666 Fifth Avenue.
Just how meaningful that plan is remains to be seen. Mr. Kushner’s representatives declined to detail his personal financial interest in Kushner Companies’ properties, and they said he intended to keep his interest in other properties beyond 666 Fifth Avenue. He also has a stake, through a family investment vehicle, in a private equity firm run by his brother, Joshua, with far-flung investments of its own.
Mr. Kushner, who turns 36 on Tuesday, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Mr. Trump’s orbit. Already he is involved in steering policy, making personnel choices and serving as the middleman between foreign leaders, the White House and the president-elect in ways that could affect his business, even as companies like Anbang see opportunity in entering into new ventures with the president-elect’s son-in-law.
Mr. Kushner played a pivotal role in persuading Mr. Trump, who made the Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs a bête noire of his presidential campaign, to appoint the firm’s president, 
, as his chief economic adviser, according to several people involved in the transition. (Like a number of people interviewed for this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.) Goldman Sachs has lent the Kushner Companies money and is an investor in a real estate technology company co-founded by Mr. Kushner and his brother.
Mr. Trump has said that his son-in-law, an Orthodox Jew, will 
, describing him as so talented that he could help “do peace in the Middle East.” Mr. Kushner’s company has received multiple loans from Israel’s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim. The incoming Trump administration will inherit a 
 investigation into allegations that the bank helped wealthy Americans evade taxes.
Indeed, despite a lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Kushner is emerging as an important figure at a crucial moment for some of America’s most complicated diplomatic relationships. Such is his influence in the geopolitical realm that transition officials have told the Obama White House that foreign policy matters that need to be brought to Mr. Trump’s attention should be relayed through his son-in-law, according to a person close to the transition and a government official with direct knowledge of the arrangement.
So when the Chinese ambassador to the United States called the White House in early December to express what one official called China’s “deep displeasure” at Mr. Trump’s break with longstanding diplomatic tradition by 
, the White House did not call the president-elect’s national security team. Instead, it relayed that information through Mr. Kushner, whose company was not only in the midst of discussions with Anbang but also has Chinese investors.
Ethics experts said that while the conflict-of-interest law is narrowly drawn, Mr. Kushner’s mix of roles leads inevitably to ethical questions.
Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul’s presidential campaign, said deals like the one with Anbang “might not be illegal under the conflict-of-interest rules, but raise a strong appearance that a foreign entity is using Mr. Kushner’s business to try to influence U.S. policy.”
Without knowing details of Mr. Kushner’s holdings and divestiture plans, he said, the merits of his proposal are hard to assess. Even if he divests his stake in certain properties, Mr. Sanderson added, “it strikes me as a half-measure” that “still poses a real conflict-of-interest issue and would be a drag on Mr. Trump’s presidency and cause the American people to question Mr. Kushner’s role in policy making.”
Like the president-elect, Mr. Kushner built on the fortune of a successful father.
In the 1980s, his father, Charles Kushner, took over the New Jersey-based construction business started by his own father, a Holocaust survivor from Poland. Charles expanded into office buildings and apartments, eventually assembling a $1 billion real estate business and becoming 
, contributing to politicians in New Jersey and New York and 
 of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
But the company was upended when Charles became engulfed in a nasty family feud over how the business’s proceeds were to be distributed. The fight, which played out in a federal courthouse in Newark, resulted in a plea deal for Charles, who in 2005 was 
 for tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. The family infighting was so bitter that, at one point, Charles hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, videotaped the encounter and sent the footage to his sister.
Jared, 23 at the time of his father’s conviction, had recently graduated from Harvard. He was studying for an M.B.A. and law degree at New York University in 2006 when he bought The New York Observer, at the time an influential weekly newspaper known for its coverage of the city’s elite and high-end real estate.
It is unclear exactly when he assumed control of the family business. The company now says he became chief executive in 2008, but contemporaneous news accounts rarely describe him that way until 2012. Nevertheless, Mr. Kushner quickly became the company’s public face as it expanded across the Hudson River into Manhattan, much as Mr. Trump had left Queens for the big city decades before.
Charles Kushner was released from federal custody in August 2006. He immediately resumed a significant role in the business and remains heavily involved today. Still, it was with Jared as headliner that the company soon made its biggest play ever: $1.8 billion for the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue that would remain at the center of its story to this day. It was the highest price ever paid for a single office building in the United States — and more than three times what its seller had paid six years earlier.
Around this time, Mr. Kushner met the woman he would marry: Ivanka Trump. “J-Vanka,” 
, as the New York tabloids celebrated a match made in real estate heaven.
Everything was looking up, until suddenly it wasn’t. Within a year after the deal, the overheated lending market seized up and Kushner Companies struggled to repay its considerable loans — and to hold on to 666 Fifth Avenue. To the rescue over the next few years came the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity firm; Vornado Realty Trust, then a co-owner of two of Mr. Trump’s largest properties; and Inditex, owner of Zara, the fashion retailer founded by Amancio Ortega, the Spanish tycoon who is one of the world’s wealthiest men.
In the end, Mr. Kushner’s company survived, and he and Ms. Trump became fixtures on the international boldface-name circuit.
In August, they were spotted with Wendi Deng, an ex-wife of Rupert Murdoch, on the 453-foot yacht Rising Sun, owned by the entertainment mogul David Geffen. Several weeks later, they were photographed watching the United States Open tennis finals with the art collector Dasha Zhukova, wife of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin’s inner circle.
Since 2012, Kushner Companies has been on a buying spree. It has acquired at least 120 properties, mostly a mix of existing commercial and residential buildings in New York and New Jersey, according to data compiled by Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.
Recent deals include the $340 million acquisition of the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ headquarters in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, and $345 million for a nearby plot of undeveloped land. Mr. Kushner’s company also bought several floors of the old New York Times building for $295 million in 2015 from Lev Leviev, an Israeli who is chairman of one of the largest real estate development companies in Russia.
Increasingly, the company is branching out across the country — to Philadelphia; Baltimore; Toledo, Ohio; and Kansas City, Mo. In Chicago, it owns the building that houses the Midwest headquarters of AT&T. In all, the company owns more than 20,000 apartments and approximately 14 million square feet of office space.
As the Kushners have expanded their businesses, they have also, by necessity, expanded their universe of investors and creditors. Lenders have included private equity giants like Blackstone, the French bank Natixis and Goldman Sachs. Another lender is Deutsche Bank, which recently 
 with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. But it remains under investigation over allegations that it disguised trades that helped Russian clients move money offshore.
Beyond real estate, Mr. Kushner has moved into the Wall Street, health care and tech spaces.
He has an indirect investment in Thrive Capital, a 
 valued at about $1.5 billion that is run by his brother, Joshua. The company has made more than 100 investments in dozens of companies, both in the United States and abroad. Among them is 
, a health insurance company founded in 2012 to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle. Oscar’s investors have included Li Ka-shing, who is one of Hong Kong’s richest men, and China’s Ping An Insurance, which has close ties to relatives of former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China.
The Kushner brothers have counted the Russian billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner and the Chinese billionaire founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, as investors in another endeavor — 
, a tech-savvy real estate investment company they started with a friend. Goldman Sachs has invested in both tech ventures.
But the money behind many of Mr. Kushner’s real-estate investments remains a mystery. While the company lists dozens of partners on its website, it does not disclose the individuals behind those companies.
One of the newest Kushner projects — a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November in Jersey City — got nearly a quarter of its financing, about $50 million, from Chinese investors who are not publicly identified.
The investors are beneficiaries of a federal program that grants two-year visas and a path to permanent residency in exchange for investments of $500,000. The program, known as EB-5, has become popular with real estate developers as a cheap form of financing; in fiscal year 2015, the State Department issued 9,764 of the visas — 
.
But the program, which must be renewed periodically by Congress, has lately 
. The Government Accountability Office has 
 raising concerns about what it termed the program’s insufficient background checks and lax safeguards against illicit financing. One applicant, the agency found, failed to report potential financial
.
Then there are the Kushners’ continuing negotiations with Anbang’s Mr. Wu, one of the most politically connected men in China.
In 2015, Mr. Kushner began pursuing a grand vision for 666 Fifth Avenue. The renowned architect Zaha Hadid was asked to come up with a design to resculpt the 40-story, 1950s-era aluminum-clad office building, adding apartments, a hotel and a mall and nearly tripling its height to 1,400 feet.
But the plan needed money, and while Mr. Kushner had managed to hang on to his family’s flagship building, it still had a lot of debt, with a $1.1 billion loan coming due in 2019, and a good portion of the commercial office space vacant.
Anbang, which got its start as an auto insurance company in 2004, had become one of the most aggressive Chinese buyers of United States real estate, and had begun investing in hotels. But it had encountered problems of its own; its byzantine ownership structure had given rise to concern on Wall Street and in Washington.
 that Anbang is owned by a few dozen companies, which in turn are owned by a number of shell companies that are controlled by roughly 100 people, many of whom have ties to a county in China that is the home of Mr. Wu, whose own power stems in part from marriage. In his case he married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Mr. Wu also counts as a central business partner the son of a People’s Liberation Army marshal, and he has recruited several former government insurance regulators to serve on his board.
Anbang’s structure has stoked such suspicion about its true ownership that some Wall Street firms, including Morgan Stanley, have opted not to advise the company on United States mergers and acquisitions because they cannot get the information needed to satisfy their “know your client” guidelines.
Anbang’s deep ties to the Chinese state have also led to a break in presidential protocol. Presidents have long stayed at the Waldorf, but when Mr. Obama visited New York for the opening of a session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, he 
. American officials were vague about the reasons for the change at the time; a senior national security official cited security, counterintelligence and cybersurveillance concerns.
National security concerns have also complicated Anbang’s efforts to acquire other properties in the United States.
One deal, to buy the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, fell apart in October amid concerns from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which comprises the heads of nine federal agencies and is charged with reviewing the national security risks of transactions involving foreign governments or state-connected companies. The Hotel del Coronado is near a naval base, and deals involving proximity to national security infrastructure typically receive heightened scrutiny. Anbang was, however, able to acquire the other hotels in the same collection.
Last year, Anbang tried to purchase the Starwood Hotels chain, 
. It was widely reported that the deal would be subject to review by the committee. But though the parties expressed confidence that it would pass muster, ultimately 
 before submitting the kind of detailed inside information that process would entail.
And while Anbang’s planned $1.57 billion purchase of Des Moines-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, first announced in November 2015, was cleared by the committee, also known as Cfius, it 
 after the New York State Department of Financial Services demanded more information about Anbang’s shareholding structure.
But Anbang was nothing if not savvy. Company officials had cultivated a relationship with Benjamin M. Lawsky, who had earlier led the financial services agency, from May 2011 to June 2015. It was Mr. Lawsky, by then a consultant, who introduced Anbang to Kushner Companies, according to people with knowledge of how the discussions came about. Mr. Lawsky declined to comment.
Mr. Kushner led the negotiations, his spokeswoman, Ms. Heller, confirmed. Kushner Companies would disclose little else about the joint venture, except to say that Anbang would become one of the equity partners in the building’s redevelopment if an agreement is finalized. Anbang declined to comment.
It was just coincidence that Mr. Kushner’s Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf with Mr. Wu took place the week after the election, Ms. Heller said, adding that it had been in the works for a while.
By the time of the meeting, Mr. Kushner had decided to hand off certain business relationships, including the one with Anbang, to others at Kushner Companies, according to Ms. Heller, and it was for that reason that he invited his father and Laurent Morali, the president of Kushner Companies. She said he planned to sell his stake in 666 Fifth before the closing of any Anbang deal, but she declined to name the potential buyers or the price Mr. Kushner hoped to get.
Ms. Heller stressed in her statement that the United States has “not found Anbang to be a state-owned enterprise” — an important technical point, given that the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibits the acceptance of payments and gifts from foreign governments.
Should it consummate its deal with Anbang, she said, Kushner Companies will seek any necessary approvals from the federal government. She expressed confidence that any deal would pass muster with the foreign investment committee, citing the fact that it did not block the Chinese company from buying the Waldorf Astoria.
Come Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated, that committee will be made up of his cabinet members, and the process is such that the president has the final say.
It is a process with which Mr. Trump has some familiarity. During the campaign, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for supporting, as secretary of state and member of the foreign investment committee, a deal that 
 while giving the Russians control of about 20 percent of America’s uranium-extraction capacity.
On China, Mr. Trump has talked a tough game, accusing Beijing of currency manipulation and raising the possibility of a trade war. But whether that is only a negotiating tactic remains to be seen. The president-elect has his own financial entanglements with China: He owns a 30 percent stake in a partnership that owes roughly $950 million to a group of lenders that includes the Bank of China, and one of his biggest tenants at Trump Tower is another state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
With Anbang a magnet for controversy, Mr. Kushner has kept the negotiations under wraps. But a week after the Nov. 16 dinner at the Waldorf, Mr. Kushner’s father and Mr. Wu met at the hotel for lunch. After the elder Mr. Kushner departed, Mr. Wu was clearly elated.
“I love you guys,” he exclaimed in English to his remaining entourage, according to one person present.","Jared Kushner, a Trump In-Law and Adviser, Chases a Chinese Deal","JAN. 7, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/politics/jared-kushner-trump-business.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,SUSANNE CRAIG
"HONG KONG — With pollution levels receding in Beijing, parts of southern 
, including 
, experienced dangerous levels of smog Monday as weather patterns pushed bad air into the region.
The worsening conditions caused the Hong Kong government to warn of a “very high” health risk, particularly for the elderly, children and those with existing respiratory conditions.
The level of PM2.5 pollution, the fine particulates that pose the greatest danger to health, exceeded 190 micrograms per cubic meter on Sunday in Hong Kong, and the high levels continued into Monday. The World Health Organization 
 daily exposure of no more than 25 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter, and levels above 150 are considered “unhealthy.”
Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department blamed shifting weather patterns for the pollution, as sunny and dry conditions on Sunday essentially trapped haze over the region.
“Hong Kong is being affected by an airstream with higher background pollutant concentrations,” a department spokesman said. “The light wind hinders effective dispersion of air pollutants. The sunshine enhances photochemical smog activities and the formation of ozone during the daytime, resulting in high pollution in the region.”
Nearby Chinese provinces Guangdong and Hainan also had unhealthy levels of pollution.
By contrast, Beijing was starting to get a slight reprieve after an extended bout of filthy air, although pollution levels there and in other northern Chinese cities remained high.
On Friday, the Chinese minister for environmental protection, Chen Jining, told reporters in Beijing that air quality had generally improved but that it would take a while to wean the Chinese economy from relying on heavy industry and fossil fuels that cause the smog. He also said that the unusually static air across northern China recently had contributed to the buildup.
“Cleaning up atmospheric pollution can’t be done in an instant,” Mr. Chen said, according to his 
. “Cleaning up atmospheric pollution is a war of offense, but it’s also a war of endurance.”
The pollution in Hong Kong includes emissions from China’s industrial heartland in the Pearl River Delta, as well as coal burning in the winter and vehicle emissions from heavy traffic. Recent measures have helped

"HONG KONG — 
 is pushing further into the very sector that it helped to disrupt with a $2.6 billion bid for Intime Retail, a department store and mall operator in China.
Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce behemoth, already owned 28 percent of Intime, which is listed in Hong Kong, and made an offer with Shen Guo Jun, the founder of the department store chain, to take the company private.
The buyers have offered 10 Hong Kong dollars, or about $1.29, per Intime share, a 42 percent premium over its closing price on Dec. 28, when trading of its stock was suspended. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, would give Alibaba a controlling stake of about 74 percent.
The takeover of Intime is part of a strategy that makes Alibaba a rarity among major global e-commerce companies — it has spent billions buying up pieces of the very retail sector it disrupted.
The e-commerce giant argues that physical retailers will remain relevant and can be improved with technology. In that respect, it seems to be in agreement with its American peer, Amazon, which has begun experimenting with physical shopping spaces. But unlike Alibaba, Amazon has been 
.
Alibaba has also bucked the trend among its peers with logistics. Unlike Amazon and JD.com, its Chinese rival, Alibaba has shied away from owning its own inventory or trying to build out logistics.
Although China is the world’s largest delivery market, the country is still struggling with decades of underinvestment in inland logistics. This has given rise to a raft of businesses that specialize in ferrying goods to people’s homes. Alibaba comprises the majority of business for one courier, 
, which raised $1.4 billion in an initial public offering last year.
But as a result, Alibaba has also made a number of recent acquisitions and investments that seem designed in part to bolster an alliance of logistics companies that it has organized to support its enormous e-commerce sites. It took a stake in another courier company, 
, with the aim of improving its rural delivery service.
That Alibaba begins the year with a major acquisition shows that the company has no intention of slowing its merger binge. Even as some have wondered how the company can digest and manage the myriad strategic investments and acquisitions it has made in recent years, it seems set to continue buying where it sees opportunities.
Alibaba said 
 that by merging its data with Intime’s, it could get better information on customers, both online and offline, and improve inventory management.
“We don’t divide the world into real or virtual economies, only the old and new,” Daniel Zhang, the Alibaba chief executive, said in the news release. “Those who cling on to the old ways of retailing will be disrupted, and brick-and-mortar businesses will be able to create value for consumers if they are integrated with the power of mobile reach, real-time consumer insights, and technology capability to improve operating efficiency.”

"China, which has long been criticized for soaring 
 rates, actually has rates lower than previously reported, although they are still quite high, according to a large new study done jointly by Chinese and American scientists.
Public health alarms were raised in 2010 when the World Health Organization 
 of Chinese babies were delivered by cesarean rather than vaginal birth.
The 
, published last week in JAMA, found the real rate to be about 35 percent. It is still climbing slowly, despite a national policy discouraging elective C-sections.
The C-section rate varies widely by regions. In urban, wealthy Shanghai, it was recently as high as 68 percent, while in remote Tibet it is now about 4 percent.
C-sections are medically necessary to save the life of the child or the mother in 
 of all births, according to the W.H.O., and 
 found that the ideal number was about 19 percent.
China’s extraordinarily high rate is a result of its former one-child policy, changing medical care conditions and its increasingly capitalist economy.
According to the study’s authors, many parents and grandparents demand C-sections to assure that births take place on a lucky day in the astrological calendar, or because they believe that a surgically removed infant is more likely to be perfectly formed.
More than 99 percent of all women in China now give birth in hospitals — 30 years ago, only about half did. But they typically have gone through labor in open wards with no husband or family present, too few nurses and no pain relief. C-sections are an attractive alternative, said Dr. Susan C. Hellerstein, a Harvard Medical School obstetrician and one of the authors.
Doctors made more money from fees and “tips” from families if they operated, the researchers found. And if they performed scheduled surgeries rather than risk vaginal births, doctors felt they were less likely to be accused of malpractice, which is a criminal offense in China, or to face angry families demanding compensation.
Vaginal births can quickly go wrong if, for example, the cord wraps around the baby’s neck.
The study was led by doctors from China’s national statistics office, Peking University, Harvard Medical School and New York University’s Wagner School of Public Service.
The 2010 W.H.O. survey erred by relying on figures from just 21 hospitals, mostly in cities, said Dr. Jan Blustein, a health policy specialist at N.Y.U. and co-author. The new study tallied 90 percent of the country’s births over seven years.
While a few cities like Shanghai had astronomical rates, half of all Chinese still live in rural areas where home births are more common and distances to hospitals are greater, so actual rates are closer to the ideal 10 to 20 percent range.
In Tibet, however, C-sections are so rare that mothers and children who could be saved from death are undoubtedly not getting the operations, Dr. Hellerstein said. C-sections save lives in breech or 
, for example, or when a mother has dangerously 
 or a fetal heartbeat fails.
But babies born by C-section are more likely to hospitalized for breathing problems and more likely to suffer 
 and 
 later in life, possibly as a result of not getting microbes present in the birth canal. Mothers who have had C-sections also are more likely to hemorrhage or to have a uterine rupture in the next 
.
Since 2009, China has been trying to control medically unnecessary cesareans by educating patients, doctors and 
, and by warning individual hospitals when their rates are too high, said Dr. Jianmeng Liu, director of the Office for National Maternal and Child Health Statistics of China and a study co-author.
China’s C-section rate, the authors noted, is close to that of the United States, where it is 
.
That rate is 
, and higher than in many European countries, the authors said. Some mothers choose C-sections to avoid labor pains, they said, and too many doctors suggest them for convenience and for fear of facing malpractice suits.

“All these older women wanting a second baby after a C-section is going to be a big challenge,” Dr. Hellerstein said.","Study Finds Lower, but Still High, Rate of C-Sections in China","JAN. 9, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/health/c-section-births-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,DONALD G.

"BEIJING — President-elect Donald J. Trump has called 
 a “hoax” created by 
 and said he would withdraw from the global Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
That threat has lent new urgency to a question that has loomed over the agreement since it was signed in 2015: whether China will properly report and submit its carbon emissions data for verification.
Like some other nations, China, the world’s biggest polluter, has refused to accept international monitoring of its emissions and says it will provide data to outside observers. In the past, conflicting data about the country’s energy use has 
.
Under President Obama, American officials worked to pressure China and other developing nations to provide more accurate data, viewing that as a difficult but critical part of establishing clear global benchmarks in climate change policy.
China has indicated that it wants to take on a leadership role to promote the Paris Agreement. But if Washington withdraws or lets up on its demands, the incentives for Beijing to do that through greater transparency will be greatly reduced.
The 
 rests on a foundation of transparency and good faith: Countries are supposed to report and submit for verification their carbon emissions data. Without accurate and timely reporting, there is no way to monitor progress and adjust policies.
International negotiators are expected to draw up standards that will apply to both developed and developing countries, unlike the bifurcated reporting requirements of older climate deals. This means that China and India will be compelled to provide the same kinds of information as, say, France and Japan.
At a 
, Morocco, in November, officials discussed a plan to establish standards and mechanisms for reporting emissions. Over the next two years, negotiators will engage in “the most technically complex and politically contentious issues,” said Li Shuo, a Beijing-based climate policy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia.
China, he said, “still has a long way to improve its transparency system.”
A country’s greenhouse gas output is determined by extrapolating data about energy use rather than directly measuring it. Accurate annual coal consumption statistics are critical for these calculations because 
 is the biggest source of greenhouse gas pollution.
But China’s coal statistics are subject to official corrections and changes, and updates are released just once every five years, when the country conducts an economic census.
The 
 revealed that China’s coal-derived energy use was 
 than previous estimates for every year since 2005. Furthermore, there are persistent differences between coal consumption statistics reported on the provincial and national levels.
“Over time, it would be desirable if the reporting systems are improved,” said Glen Peters, a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo. “The fact that the census leads to 10 percent revisions in such an important commodity is a little worrying.”
He added, “The U.S., for example, also has revisions, but generally less than 1 percent in the first year and maybe 0.1 percent in following years.”
Another problem is that China has been reluctant to release its own calculations of emissions, so other nations rely on calculations made by foreign scientists.
The Chinese government 
 emissions estimates to the United Nations only twice, for 1994 and 2005. Most other developing nations have also submitted only two estimates, but some, including Brazil and Mexico, have 
.
There is “no good reason” China is dragging its feet, said Mr. Li, the Greenpeace analyst.
Under the Paris Agreement, countries will have to submit estimates every two years. “International forces are quite attractive in terms of putting pressure on improving the transparency system,” Mr. Li said.
At a 
 in November, Xie Zhenhua, a special envoy on climate issues, said that although he believed China’s data was accurate, China was still a developing nation and struggling to establish the same type of reporting and verification systems that developed nations used.
“It was mentioned in the Paris agreement that a greater degree of flexibility should be offered to developing countries, and, first of all, funding and technical support should be provided to them to help improve their capacity,” Mr. Xie said.
“How to establish a system of transparency should only be considered on this basis,” he added. “China is also in such a phase of development.”
China will compile emissions data from four data sources: national and provincial governments, businesses, and a planned 
 carbon market, said Chai Qimin, a senior director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.
The different areas of reporting “can be used to check against one another,” he said. “At least major discrepancies won’t happen.”
Mr. Chai and other climate researchers and policy advisers played down how large the carbon market would be by the end of 2017. They said Chinese officials had said only that the market would “launch,” not be fully operational.
China has been experimenting with seven regional pilot cap-and-trade markets. Mr. Xie, the climate envoy, said that as of September, the cumulative total turnover of carbon dioxide in those pilot markets was 120 million metric tons, and the cumulative transaction amount had exceeded 3.2 billion renminbi, or $473 million.
But some experts say a carbon tax would be a better way of putting a cost on carbon. Other scholars say the pilot programs have suffered from operational problems that could bode ill for the national market.
“I estimate that it will surely be launched in 2017, although there will be many difficulties, and the progress is unlikely to be fast,” said Jiang Kejun, a senior researcher at the Energy Research Institute, part of China’s Economic Development Agency. “For it to truly play a vital role, I think we’ll have to wait until 2019 or 2020.”
In any case, researchers say, other market forces are helping for now. They expect coal consumption in China to 
, as has been 
. That is mainly because of the slowing Chinese economy. China promised two years ago that its greenhouse gas emissions would peak in 2030 — a goal that experts now say will be met easily.
Some are even suggesting that emissions 
 for the long term, though an emissions peak can be confirmed only years after it has happened.
Mr. Peters’s group estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption and cement production in China 
 from the year before. Those kinds of numbers have been a pleasant surprise for climate negotiators and researchers.
On Thursday, the Chinese National Energy Administration announced a plan for 2016 to 2020 in which the country would 
 and create more than 13 million jobs in that sector. A related coal plan predicted marginal growth in coal consumption, estimating that the amount consumed in 2020 would be 4.1 billion metric tons, a 3.5 percent increase over 2015.
But Mr. Li said the five-year energy plans constantly overestimated China’s energy needs. Greenpeace calculations show annual coal consumption dropped in 2016, he said, and “it is hard to see how a 100-million-ton growth of coal would be possible.”","China Wants to Be a Climate Change Watchdog, but Can It Lead by Example?","JAN. 10, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/world/asia/china-wants-to-be-a-climate-change-watchdog-but-cant-yet-lead-by-example.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EDWARD WONG
"HONG KONG — 
’s call for 
 to be denied access to its artificial islands in the South China Sea, made Wednesday during his confirmation hearing for secretary of state, set the stage for a possible crisis between the world’s two biggest economies should his comments become official American policy.
Mr. Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that China’s multibillion-dollar island-building campaign in the 
-and-gas rich sea was illegal and “akin to Russia’s taking of Crimea.”
“We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops,” Mr. Tillerson told the senators. “And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.”
Should those words be translated into action after 
 assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, it would be a remarkable change in the American approach to Beijing’s island-building in the South China Sea, which is transforming the area into what one Washington think tank said would by 2030 become “
.” China asserts sovereignty over most of the South China Sea despite competing claims by countries including Vietnam and the Philippines and an international ruling rejecting most of Beijing’s assertions.
The Obama administration has challenged what it calls China’s “excessive maritime claims” in the sea by sailing warships close to the artificial islands, some of which feature deep harbors and runways capable of handling jumbo jets. But that has not stopped China from continuing its buildup, which now includes military installations such as 
 on more than 3,000 acres of artificial land built on reefs and shoals.
Mr. Tillerson’s comments, with the possible implication that the United States might use its armed forces to deny the Chinese access to the islands, garnered reactions including confusion, disbelief and warlike threats from analysts in China.
“This is a signal, now that Trump is set to take office, that he wants to have a tough stand on China,” said Yang Chengjun, a retired senior colonel and military expert, who said that China’s potential war-fighting capability was greater than America’s. “China does not stir up troubles but we are not afraid of them when they come.”
Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, declined to answer a reporter’s question about what Beijing might do if the United States Navy moved to deny China access to the islands, saying it was a “hypothetical question.”
But his reaction also highlighted the confusion sown by the testimony, because Mr. Tillerson did not explain how the United States could block China from the islands.
“I can’t predict what Mr. Tillerson is thinking specifically, and on the other hand, it is impossible for me to make any prediction about China’s policy, based on your assumptions of what he said,” Mr. Lu said.
That confusion was shared by one of China’s most prominent experts on the South China Sea, who also questioned the legality of any American effort to block access to the islands.
“Is this a warning? Or will this be a policy option?” said Zhu Feng, executive director of the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea at Nanjing University. “If this is a policy option, this will not be able to block China’s access to these constructed islands. There is no legal basis.”
Mr. Trump’s transition team did not respond to emailed questions asking for details on Mr. Tillerson’s remarks, and whether they represented the intended policy of the United States after Mr. Trump assumes the presidency.
What is also not clear is the extent to which Mr. Tillerson’s tough stance on the South China Sea springs from his extensive experience in the region during his time as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, when his company became embroiled in bitter territorial disputes over the extensive oil and gas reserves beneath the seafloor.
During his tenure, the company forged close ties to the Vietnamese government, signing an agreement in 2009 with a state-owned firm to drill for oil and gas in two areas in the South China Sea. The agreement with 
 was signed quietly, according to a 
 United States diplomatic cable, because it conflicted with Chinese territorial claims.
While Exxon Mobil has some operations in China, including a stake in a 
 in the country’s south, it has a very small presence in the country’s huge retail market for gasoline, which is dominated by state-owned Chinese companies. In contrast, its agreements with Vietnam are potentially huge, given that the South China Sea may contain 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 
.
A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Singapore did not return a phone call asking for comment about the company’s operations in Vietnam. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry did not reply to a request for comment about Mr. Tillerson’s remarks.
But his statements have put further strains on one of the world’s most important bilateral relationships. Policy directions set by President Richard M. Nixon more than 40 years ago have remained relatively steady under the Republican and Democratic administrations that followed. But Mr. Trump’s talk of enacting new tariffs on Chinese goods and his willingness to 
 of protocol by taking a phone call from Taiwan’s president have called those policies into question.

"President 
 of 
 plans to stride into the snowy high-altitude conclave of the world’s financial elite next week, attending the 
 at Davos, Switzerland, the first time a top Chinese leader will put himself into the mix of political leaders and business executives who view themselves as the masters of the global economy.
 by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. It is the latest, and in some ways the boldest, Chinese attempt to compete with the United States’ dominant position in world economic and strategic institutions, a decades-long campaign that has been carried out everywhere from the conference rooms of Asian central banks to the waters of the South China Sea to the halls of the United Nations in New York.
But it is unclear whether Mr. Xi, who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world’s second largest economy, can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the United States is pulling back from global leadership.
Mr. Xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point. He plans to deliver a speech at Davos at a moment when the incoming United States president, 
, has suggested that the United States should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since World War II, including its leadership of a global free trade agenda.
In recent years, Davos had come to embody that American-led agenda — a gathering at an Alpine ski resort of some of the world’s most powerful figures in the realms of politics, media and technology. Discussions each year have been set by Western leaders, not Asian ones.
But events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization, free trade and inequality in some Western nations, including the United States, with Davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries’ ailments.
 has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the World Trade Organization, and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system. Mr. Trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced China for competing unfairly against the United States.
At Davos, Mr. Xi plans to lead a delegation of senior officials, China’s wealthiest entrepreneurs and top executives of state-owned enterprises, including the 
, which has ties to the Chinese military.
People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, published an article Wednesday that said China could become the “torchbearer of the open trade system” and boasted that Mr. Xi’s visit “will boost the world’s confidence in global governance.”
His appearance is a logical step in his country’s evolution into a globe-spanning superpower, a rapid transformation that has been marked by bold symbolic gestures and events in the past decade, including the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under President Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi’s predecessor.
Mr. Xi has carried on that theme with much more aggressive actions, including overseeing construction of military infrastructure in the 
 and establishing a 
 opposed by the United States.
Premiers of China, including the current one, Li Keqiang, have attended Davos before, but the nation’s president — and head of the Communist Party — has never been to the gathering.
“Clearly it signals that 
 is now interested in writing both China and himself in a grander way on the global diplomatic horizon,” said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. “He feels it’s time to really come out. Behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the U.S. is in disarray, Europe is feckless, and so on.”
“He’ll be received almost as the number one citizen at Davos,” Mr. Schell added.
Mr. Xi plans to attend Davos on Jan. 17, during a state visit to Switzerland from Jan. 15 to 18, said Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Mr. Xi is expected to speak at the opening session of the forum, which runs from Jan. 17 to 20.
Strong anti-globalization sentiments erupted last year in the movement in Britain that culminated in the popular vote by British citizens to leave the European Union. But it was Mr. Trump’s election in November that was the apotheosis of the move in the West toward isolationism, and meetings and conversations at Davos — whose theme this year is “responsive and responsible leadership” — will take place in the shadow of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and rhetoric.
“It’s going to be very tempting for China to imagine for itself that it’s gained much more status after this election in a whole array of global endeavors, including trade and 
 and possibly other issues,” Mr. Schell said. “If the U.S. is going to absent itself more — and we don’t know if that’s the case yet — nature does abhor a vacuum. When a father grows old, the son is sometimes able to fill the space.”
Victor Shih, a scholar of China’s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said there are actually some global agenda matters on which China’s influence “might have peaked in the medium term.”
He pointed to China’s push in recent years to have the renminbi counted as an international currency. That has been undermined in the past year by efforts of the Chinese central bank, the People’s Bank of China, to withdraw large quantities of offshore renminbi from circulation. The bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from China, including the transfer of money to Hong Kong by wealthy Chinese.
“The People’s Bank of China continues to claim that renminbi internationalization is important, and of course, at Davos, President Xi may continue to pay verbal homage to that agenda because it would be an important sign of China’s ascendance on the world stage,” Mr. Shih said. “Yet, in the past year, we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland China decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi.”
Among the Chinese tycoons expected to attend Davos are 
, founder of the Wanda Group, a property and cinema company, and Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, China’s biggest e-commerce company.
They are commonly referred to as the two wealthiest men in China. Both are investing in the United States, and Mr. Ma 
 at Trump Tower in New York to discuss business opportunities between companies in the two countries. (Within Mr. Trump’s family, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been involved in 
 with top Chinese executives.)

"Transnational is the new buzzword in curatorial circles, aimed at artists whose cultural identity is fluid, a hybrid of the many countries where they have lived, studied and now work.
Cici Wu, Ho King Man and Wang Xu are three such artists, who were born in China, educated in the United States and now call New York their home. In 2015 they turned their shared studio in Chinatown into an ad hoc alternative art space and impromptu residency program called Practice. Run on a shoestring budget that’s covered by their income from part-time jobs, and with no website, Practice has attracted a word-of-mouth following among young international artists who, like the founders, lead nomadic lives.
“What we are trying to do is to find a new alternative to identity politics, to put our Chinese identity on a lower level and open ourselves to something more focused on the relationship between the three of us,” said Ms. Wu, a recent M.F.A. graduate of the Maryland Institute College of Art who endearingly works artspeak into heartfelt statements about their mission.
Ms. Wu and her two partners now have a new opportunity to test their ideas, not as curators but as artists, at their first collaborative show, opening this week at the 
. Working to the last minute to finish the installation, they are similar to many artists who have limited gallery experience, despite having run a space of their own.
“They are still in that very idealistic place in their practice and they have a very open-ended idea about what this exhibition experience can be,” said Margaret Lee, a founder of 47 Canal and its director.
Mr. Wang has the most developed solo career and regularly shuttles among artist residencies, a studio in Beijing and the Practice space on Eldridge Street. Yet he hardly can be described as a jet setter, coming from a modest family in Dalian, where his father was a taxi driver. Having studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing and Columbia University’s graduate program in visual arts, Mr. Wang combines formal Chinese training in realist sculpture with a Conceptual bent that he picked up in New York.
He presents a contemporary version of a Greek kouros, a standing nude minus a head, with a surface of pebbly gray clay that seems as if it might disintegrate at any moment. Antique hooks placed around the body turn the work into a somewhat silly coat rack that invites interaction but diminishes its impact.
Mr. Wang’s video is more engaging, projected on an adjacent wall. He traces his steps during a residency upstate in which he lived in a hut made of wood and clay gathered from the forest. Here, his only human interaction is with the resident gardener, who creates crop circles in lush fields as he rides on a mower the size of a golf cart. In the course of the 11-minute video, Mr. Wang makes clay and fashions an oversize bust of the gardener, building layer upon layer by hand until the sculpture becomes a realistic rendition of the man before him.
Ms. Wu, who grew up in Beijing and studied in Hong Kong before coming to the States in 2012, has developed an intriguing vocabulary that uses electronics and machinery to surprisingly intimate effect. To create her installation “Closer, Closer, Says Love,” she sneaked into movie theaters with a device that recorded the ambient light, not the film being shown. The resulting imageless video is then projected onto a mechanism with light sensors (not unlike an automatic door) that responds by shuttling two ragged sleeve cuffs back and forth, like forlorn lovers who keep trying to meet but are ultimately yanked apart. Casting shadows on the wall of the gallery, the installation conveys the sense of watching a romantic encounter, achieved almost magically with minimal, mundane materials.
Finally, a spotlight on a small book resting on a wooden table invites viewers to read the words within its pages. This work, by Mr. Ho, provides an English translation of the poetry of 
, a Beijing photographer best known for his surrealistic images of naked young models in provocative poses. Mr. Ren likes to post poems to his website that are equally suggestive, with titles like “Each Time I Do Something Bad.”
Here, his poems take center stage — no photographs are on view — revealing to American audiences a fresh voice that in this setting can only be engaged by one person at a time. Mr. Ho, who was born in a small town in the south of China, moved with his family to the United States in 2000 and attended Fordham Law School; he is still experimenting with the possibilities of installation, not having yet achieved a fully resolved work.
As a whole, this exhibition has a sweet sentimentality that defies presumed notions of what global Conceptual art should look like or address. “We are attracted to work with an inner independence,” Mr. Ho has said, describing Practice’s criteria for working with artists. The phrase applies equally to the works on view, which are refreshingly free of the critiques of socioeconomic conditions and commodities that often sprout at biennials and art fairs. Everything here is brought to an intimate level, creating the sense of a conversation within a small circle of friends who happen to be participants in a borderless, international network.",Review: Chinese Cultural Nomads Find an Oasis,"JAN. 12, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/arts/design/chinese-cultural-nomads-find-an-oasis.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,BARBARA POLLACK
"HONG KONG — 
 scrambled F-16 fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after 
 sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway, Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported.
The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after President-elect 
 
 by speaking on the phone with Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, after his election victory. Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwan’s formal independence from China.
Ms. Tsai, who is visiting Central America this week, made two calls to officials in Taiwan seeking updates on the Liaoning’s transit, the Central News Agency reported, citing Alex Huang, the president’s spokesman. China’s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from Taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. Trump.
“It’s a show of force, and I think it is intended in part to intimidate, and that’s worrisome from the U.S. and Taiwan’s point of view because we don’t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “If the Trump administration does see this as a test of U.S. resolve, I suspect they’ll push back pretty forcefully.”
China sent the carrier, which had been 
 in the South China Sea, into the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday morning. Taiwan’s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity, after 
 on Monday. Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate Japan and South Korea and over the Sea of Japan.
Taiwan, considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory, has been governed separately since 1949, when the forces of the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the Communists. China views any assertion of Taiwan’s separateness from the mainland — like Ms. Tsai’s call with Mr. Trump — as an affront to its claim of sovereignty.
Since 1979, the United States has recognized the government in Beijing and broke off formal diplomatic ties to Taiwan as part of the 
. In the wake of the Trump-Tsai call, 
 against making changes to that policy after he takes office on Jan. 20.
Liu Zhenmin, a Chinese vice foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the Taiwan Strait was an international waterway and that it was normal for the Liaoning to pass though it. The passage would not have any effect on cross-strait relations, 
 carried in the Chinese news media.
Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, 
 in Washington in response to a question about the Liaoning’s passage through the strait that the United States “wouldn’t have a problem” with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law.
It also was not the first time the Liaoning had sailed through the strait: 
 in November 2013 on its way to the South China Sea after having been commissioned only the year before.
In that instance, the carrier kept to the western half of the strait, closer to mainland China. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said that the Liaoning was also staying to the west of the strait’s middle and urged citizens to remain calm. A transit on the eastern side, closer to Taiwan, would be viewed as much more provocative.
Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said that for the Chinese, traveling through the strait was a logical way to move from one area of fleet operations to another along its long coastline. In order for warships based in northern ports, like the Liaoning, to return home from southern waters, they must either pass close to Japanese islands or transit the Taiwan Strait. “Geography forces a very binary choice,” he said.
Mr. Graham said it was important to see how the Liaoning conducted its passage. If it had aircraft on deck and was conducting flight operations, that would be seen as more provocative than if it passed through the strait with the aircraft in its hangar bay, he said.
The Liaoning, commissioned in 2012 and built from a Soviet hull, is China’s first aircraft carrier. In past decades, the United States has shown its resolve to defend Taiwan by sailing carriers through the Taiwan Strait. In 1995, the aircraft carrier Nimitz 
 amid heightened tensions after Beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters.
China’s military decision-making is highly secretive, but it would seem inconceivable for the Liaoning to pass through such contested waters without approval from the president, Xi Jinping, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the military. And the Chinese military media has described the aircraft carrier as embodying Mr. Xi’s plans for a stronger navy, capable of projecting force far beyond China’s territorial waters.
Last Thursday, the front page of People’s Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, 
 about the aircraft carrier’s latest journey under the headline, “We’re sailing under the leader’s attentive gaze,” a clear tribute to Mr. Xi.
Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the Liaoning’s passage was part of the ship’s scheduled training in the western Pacific, which had begun on Dec. 24.
Mr. Ma also said that the Taiwan-China relationship in the coming year would face “increasing uncertainty, looming risks and challenges.”
He added that Taiwan’s government and “independence forces” there had “seriously threatened the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,” accusing them of engaging in separatist activities and warning that China would “resolutely safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
The aircraft carrier’s passage was part of a cluster of recent acts by the Chinese military that have raised hackles in the region.
Last month, a Chinese warship 
 belonging to the United States Navy about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The drone was returned after the Obama administration publicly chided China over the seizure. On Monday, 
 it had sent fighter jets into the air after Chinese bombers and surveillance planes flew over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan.
“When China was militarily weaker, Japan considered that area to be its backyard,” said 
, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “This was a way of telling Japan that if there ever is conflict, the location of any future battle space won’t be decided by you and America.

"BEIJING — For generations, the “Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression” has been ingrained in the minds of Chinese schoolchildren. Revolutionary hymns evoked the bloody years, from 1937 to 1945, of what is known outside 
 as the Second Sino-Japanese War. Chinese documentaries denounced 
’s “eight years of belligerence.”
Now the war is getting a new name, and an extended time frame.
In a move aimed at stirring up nationalism and support for the ruling Communist Party, President Xi Jinping’s government has ordered educators to rewrite textbooks to describe the conflict as the “14-Year War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression,” lasting from 1931 to 1945, the authorities said in a statement on Wednesday.
Under the decision, the Second Sino-Japanese War will be described as having started in the fall of 1931, when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Manchuria. Previously, the war’s beginning had been traced to the Marco Polo Bridge incident, a skirmish in 1937 between Japanese forces and Chinese troops along a rail line southwest of Beijing that represented the beginning of full-scale conflict.
The Chinese Ministry of Education said the decision to add six years to the war sought to promote patriotic education and to highlight the Communist Party’s “core role” in resisting Japanese fascism in the prelude to 
. It also seemed intended to rally support for the party among young people as Mr. Xi vigorously promotes Communist history and thought in schools.
Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, said the decision to revise the length of the war was justified from a historical perspective. But he said it would also have political benefits for the party and would encourage anti-Japanese sentiment.
“Chinese leaders still have a Cold War mentality,” he said. “They’ve tried to conjure up imaginary enemies in the world.”
Mr. Xi has worked in recent years to enhance the image of the Communists and their achievements in World War II, even though many historians believe it was the Chinese Nationalists, not the Communists, who did most of the fighting.
The party had not previously emphasized the fight against the Japanese from 1931 to 1937, when Communist forces were in disarray as they fought a civil war with the Nationalists. During that time, the Nationalists led efforts to resist the Japanese and negotiate truces. It was not until 1937 that the Communists joined forces with the Nationalists to fight an increasingly belligerent Imperial Japanese Army.
Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King’s College London, called the textbook revision a “tidying up of history.” He said the revised account exaggerated the Communists’ accomplishments.
“It demonstrates this continuing keenness by the party now to seek sources of legitimacy wherever it can,” he said, “and reveals more insecurity than real strength.”
The change will probably ruffle feathers in Japan, China’s longtime rival, as the countries jockey for influence in Asia and struggle to overcome the legacy of World War II, more than 70 years after the global conflict ended.
Yasuhisa Kawamura, press secretary for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that it was not up to the Chinese government to decide the length of the war. “It is important that Japan and China should demonstrate they do not focus excessively on the unfortunate past,” he added.
Mr. Xi has accused Japan 
, and the Chinese state news media has criticized Tokyo’s 
, saying it has played down atrocities by Japanese soldiers.
When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan 
 last month, Chinese internet users brimmed with outrage, saying Mr. Abe had not done enough to apologize to China for Japan’s actions during the war.
In Beijing, many people applauded the government’s decision to revise the textbooks, which are filled with references to wars against “aggression” by foreign forces. The Korean War, for example, is known as the war to resist United States aggression and aid Korea.
“The Japanese have also altered their textbooks, why can’t we?” said Wang Yalin, 30, a musician. Still, he said, the change would most likely fuel anti-Japanese sentiment in China.
Zhao Feng, 38, a tailor, acknowledged that the relationship between the countries had deteriorated. But he said it was important to note the earlier date of Japan’s invasion of China. “The occupation started much earlier,” he said.
On social media, some people were more skeptical of the government’s motives for making the change.
“Don’t use history education for political ends,” one person wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter. “The most important thing is to learn the truth.”","China, Fanning Patriotism, Adds 6 Years to War with Japan in History Books","JAN. 11, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/world/asia/china-japan-textbooks-war.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JAVIER C.

"HONG KONG — At the Addiction Treatment Center in eastern 
, more than 6,000 internet addicts — most of them teenagers — not only had their web access taken away, they were also treated with electroshock therapy.
The center, in Shandong Province, made headlines in September after one of its patients killed her mother in retribution for abuse she had purportedly suffered at the camp during a forced detox regimen.
Now China is trying to regulate camps like the one in Shandong, which have become a last resort for parents exasperated by their child’s habit of playing online games for hours on end.
The government has drafted a law that would crack down on the camps’ worst excesses, including electroshock and other “physical punishments.” Medical specialists welcomed the law, 
 in China’s state-controlled news media, as an initial step toward curbing scandals in the industry.
“It’s a very important move for protecting young children,” said Tao Ran, the director of the Internet Addiction Clinic at Beijing Military General Hospital.
Dr. Tao said that many Chinese parents believe that the effects of electroshock therapy are fleeting. But he had seen several Chinese teenagers return from boot camps that treat internet addiction showing signs of lasting psychological trauma, he said.
“They didn’t talk, were afraid to meet people and refused to leave their homes,” he said, referring to his meetings with the teenagers. “They were panicked even to hear the word ‘hospital’ and ‘doctor.’”
Qu Xinjiu, a law professor at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing, said the belief that parents have supreme jurisdiction over their children, and that even police officers have no right to intervene in family affairs, is widespread in China.
“That’s why there are so many parents sending their kids for electroshock therapy, even when outsiders think it’s wrong to do so,” Professor Qu said.
Figures on the number or growth of internet detox camps in China are scarce, but the camps’ methods have been generating concern for years.
The legislation would also limit how much time each day that minors could play online games at home or in internet bars. Providers of the games would be obliged to take measures to monitor and restrict use, such as requiring players to register under their real names.
The law does not yet specify the number of hours allowed, but minors would be prohibited from playing online games anywhere between midnight and 8 a.m.
Dr. Tao said he doubted that the draft law, which was introduced by the State Council, China’s cabinet, could be enforced evenly nationwide. Provisions to limit the number of hours spent online probably could be easily flouted, he said.
Many users of Sina Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, were even more critical, saying policing teenagers’ behavior online seemed impractical and ill-informed.
“I’m afraid it’s just empty talk,” a Sina Weibo user wrote.
“What about young kids who always go online on their cellphones?” another wrote. “Isn’t that also an addiction?”
Game providers and internet bars that did not enforce the law would be subject to fines and possible closure by the government.
Reports in the Chinese news media this week said that lawmakers would accept public comments on the draft law through early February but gave no indication of when it might be put into practice.
In 2009, the Chinese Health Ministry issued guidelines against using electroshock therapy for internet addicts. Trent M. Bax, the author of “
,” said that he wondered whether a ban would be any more effective.
Despite the Health Ministry’s policy, “punitive practices continue to victimize China’s youth” in internet detox camps, said Dr. Bax, an assistant professor of sociology at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.
Researchers from Chinese, Taiwanese and German universities 
 in 2014 that the highest prevalence of “problematic internet use” worldwide had been observed in Asia. 
, the study’s lead author, said in an email on Thursday that South Korea had the world’s highest rate of problematic internet use, in part because of its large technology sector and online game market. South Korea also offers camps for internet addiction.
Recent scientific evidence indicates that the best treatments for 
appear to be cognitive behavioral therapy in individual and group settings, which often include patients’ parents and significant others, said 
, a specialist on internet and game addiction at Nottingham Trent University in Britain.
Dr. Kuss said that medication can also be effective, especially if internet addiction is accompanied by anxiety or mood disorders, such as depression. But beatings and electroshock therapy “are not commonly used in the treatment of internet and gaming addiction and are to be considered unethical and inhumane,” she said.
Officials and psychologists around the world have debated how to measure and regulate extreme internet use. A crucial question, analysts say, is whether to classify the problem as a psychological disorder or as a symptom of underlying disorders.
In a sign of how fluid the debate is in China, the Health Ministry said in 2009 that it would no longer use the term “addiction” to describe how the internet harmed people who used it improperly or excessively.
But a study the same year by the China Youth Association for Network Development, which is led by a committee under the ruling Communist Party, found that more than 24 million Chinese, age 13 to 29, who used the internet were digital addicts.",Electroshock Therapy for Internet Addicts?

"SHANGHAI — As a top trade official, he limited the Japanese cars and steel coming into the United States. He halted talks with China on a deal that would encourage investment between the two countries. And he tried to give American exporters an edge with special tax breaks.
When it comes to problems troubling working-class Americans and manufacturers, Robert Lighthizer, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s nominee for trade representative, has historically blamed the United States’ trading partners, 
 for what he regards as widespread abuses of free-trade rules.
It is a philosophy that he developed in the 1980s as a deputy United States trade representative and fine-tuned in the decades-long career that followed as the main trade lawyer for the American steel industry. Now he appears ready to train that focus sharply on China.
“It seems clear that the U.S. manufacturing crisis is related to our trade with China,” Mr. Lighthizer said in testimony to a congressional commission in 2010.
Over the years, Mr. Lighthizer has consistently taken the position that foreign countries are subsidizing their exporters while quietly but systematically blocking imports to protect jobs in their own countries. His answer is to pursue a long list of trade measures limiting America’s imports — even if those actions may be barely permissible, if at all, under World Trade Organization rules.
“To attack a problem as large as our trade deficit with China, U.S. officials must be prepared, at a minimum, to consider very aggressive positions at the W.T.O.,” he said.
The choice of Mr. Lighthizer — and 
 it underscores — leaves China in a difficult spot. He is part of a 
 with close links to exactly the kinds of metal-bashing old-economy industries in which China faces the greatest overcapacity, and the toughest choices about how to close factories and lay off workers. Restrictions on exports to the United States will make those choices even harder for China.
Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor who is Mr. Trump’s choice to become commerce secretary, made large chunks of his fortune in steel and auto parts, two huge industries that in China are ramping up exports. Peter Navarro, the head of the new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy, is 
 of globalization who has contended that American purchases of imported goods at Walmart are helping China pay for nuclear-tipped missiles aimed at the United States.
The timing is bad for China.
The Chinese economy is slowing despite vast amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Big manufacturers in most industries are struggling with overcapacity, pushing them to sell goods overseas at cut-rate, even money-losing prices, just to cover their operating costs. Mr. Lighthizer has argued for years that the United States should keep out goods made with government subsidies or sold below the full cost of making them.
“Trump naming him makes me worry the U.S. will carry out more rigid measures on trade and investment,” said Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce.
Exports are important for China. It consistently sells $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of imports. That mismatch has produced a bilateral trade surplus for China equal to about 3 percent of the country’s entire economy, creating tens of millions of jobs.
The benefits to China from that surplus have been increasing rapidly in the past few years. Many exporters have stopped importing components and switched to increasingly capable local suppliers for everything from high-quality steel to advanced computer chips. Multinationals have moved entire supply chains to China, and transferred the technology to run them.
Many Democrats and many economists have also become increasingly disenchanted with the effect on American workers and the American economy. The Obama administration filed a long series of trade cases at the W.T.O. against China, although they involved fairly narrow policies and limited categories of goods. It has been preparing more, filing 
 on Thursday over Chinese subsidies to aluminum producers.
If Mr. Trump goes even further in that direction, Mr. Lighthizer will bring a long background in such actions.
When he was in the Reagan administration, Mr. Lighthizer was the deputy United States trade representative overseeing industrial policy in old-economy industries like cars and steel. Since then, Mr. Lighthizer has mainly been filing anti-subsidy and anti-dumping trade cases against imports on behalf of the American steel industry.
“He’s the best negotiator I’ve ever worked with on policies involving trade or tax policy,” said Timothy Regan, Mr. Lighthizer’s chief of staff in the Reagan administration and now the senior vice president of global government affairs at Corning.
Mr. Lighthizer led successful efforts in the 1980s to force Japan to accept curbs on exports of cars and steel to the United States. Both were bold moves, particularly given that President Reagan at times espoused free trade. But when the W.T.O. was created the next decade, member nations agreed, with a few exceptions, to renounce imposing such export limits on other countries.
The auto industry could be ripe for action again. China is an enormous exporter of auto parts to the United States. Under President Obama, trade tensions over automotive trade have already risen, and the Obama administration has won two W.T.O. cases. The cases forced China to abandon certain anti-dumping and anti-subsidy taxes on American autos and to dismantle a few, fairly narrow subsidies.
“He was squarely in the trade talks with Japan,” said He Weiwen, a former commerce ministry official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, an influential Beijing research group, “so maybe Donald Trump wants him to do something similar on China.”
The intersection of tax and trade is a specialty of Mr. Lighthizer, who was an architect of a Reagan administration initiative to cut corporate taxes for exporters. He was previously chief of staff at the Senate Finance Committee, overseeing tax policy.
In the Reagan administration, he pushed the limits of what is permissible under international trade rules. His plan allowed many American exporters to reduce their taxes by setting up overseas companies to manage their foreign sales. But the W.T.O. eventually torpedoed the effort after a challenge by the European Union in the late 1990s.
Republicans now appear to be taking a similar — albeit more ambitious — tack. They are exploring how to raise corporate taxes for importers and use the extra revenue to reduce taxes for all other companies.
China, as the biggest exporter to the United States, would face a major blow. But it would also affect American retailers, electronics companies and other multinationals that depend on supplies from anywhere overseas.
A big obstacle for Republicans is whether the W.T.O. would declare such a tax to be a trade barrier. China and Europe effectively penalize imports by imposing a type of national sales tax, an approach the W.T.O. has approved. It is a steep 17 percent in China.
But House Republicans, leery of imposing any new national taxes, want to change existing corporate tax laws instead. W.T.O. rules discourage, although they do not necessarily prohibit, modifying corporate taxes in ways that penalize imports.
The W.T.O. review process, though, is lengthy. So Mr. Lighthizer and Congress could well go ahead with the tax plan, lightening the tax burden for American manufacturers as well as inflicting plenty of damage on China and the global supply chain.
And the W.T.O.’s response — if it found the plan invalid — would not have much heft. Mostly, the global trade group could authorize Beijing to impose trade restrictions on the United States’ much smaller exports to China.
That prospect does not scare Mr. Lighthizer very much, as he made clear in his 2010 testimony.
“W.T.O. commitments are not religious obligations,” Mr. Lighthizer said, and violations “are not subject to coercion by some W.T.O. police force.”",Trump’s Pick on Trade Could Put China in a Difficult Spot,"JAN. 13, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/business/china-donald-trump-robert-lighthizer.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,KEITH BRADSHER
"BEIJING — As 
 was opening up 40 years ago, Jin Liqun was an ambitious young academic fascinated by 20th-century American literature and other Western works. In the fragile era after Mao’s death, the freedom to indulge in such texts was a heady experience.
William Faulkner’s novels in particular stuck with Mr. Jin, now the president of China’s 
, a major force in the country’s rush to secure a leading role in the world’s financial architecture. An underlined copy of “Absalom, Absalom!” is on his office bookshelves, along with Shakespeare and the Bible. He said he found inspiration in Faulkner’s complex human relationships.
“I look at the literature of the U.S. to get a sense of humanity’s adaptation to nature — conquering is a wrong term,” he said. “You cannot conquer nature; you have to come to terms with nature, you have to cohabit with nature, and you have to cohabit with other species in this world.”
The Obama administration refused to join the bank 
 with a surprising number of members, including the European powers and the major Asian countries, except Japan.
Yet Mr. Jin seems prepared to maneuver in the treacherous terrain between Beijing and Washington. His goal, he said, is to steer the bank toward building infrastructure across Asia in a way that is environmentally friendly and free of corruption.
Mr. Jin, 67, gray-haired and slightly rumpled, was at ease in a recent interview at the bank’s temporary headquarters in Beijing’s financial district.
In his sparsely furnished office, guests are seated at the head of a long table, with the host alongside them. That makes meetings seem more like affairs of equals, rather than a hierarchy with China at the top, as some bank members fear.
It doesn’t hurt relations with outsiders, particularly Europeans, that Mr. Jin has edited a two-volume anthology of English verse that starts with Chaucer and concludes with Seamus Heaney. Asked his favorites, he chooses T. S. Eliot, Ted Hughes and Dylan Thomas. Then he adds one more. “Ezra Pound is great, though he is a little bit controversial.”
At the 
 last year, China’s president, Xi Jinping, made it clear that no one should forget the bank is led by China. He singled out Mr. Jin for praise. That was an unusual public accolade by a Chinese leader to one of his foot soldiers, a signal that Mr. Jin had the full backing of the Chinese government.
Delicately, Mr. Jin chose another interpretation. “I think he was giving me a warning: ‘You have to do your job well because all eyes are on this bank.’”
Mr. Jin has tried to persuade skeptics in Washington that the bank is not a Chinese hegemon, at least not for now. He has smoothed prickly attitudes by agreeing to cooperate with the workhorses of the 70-year-old American-dominated 
 system — the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Still, he seems aware that the China-led bank is likely to prosper under a Trump administration that has shown little signs of interest in the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.
He pointed to an article he wrote before Donald J. Trump won the presidency. “The U.S. risks forfeiting its international relevance while stuck in its domestic political quagmire,” he wrote, adding, “History has never set any precedent that an empire is capable of governing the world forever.”
Mr. Jin has none of the family lineage that counts in getting to the top in China. He is not a 
, the rank that confers privilege on Chinese leaders by virtue of being a descendant of the revolutionary leaders of the Mao era.
But he likes to stress that he was born at a propitious moment for the Communist Party. The Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek had fled China’s east coast and the Communists were in control by the time he was born in Changsu, a river port city in Jiangsu Province, in August 1949.
“I was born under the red flag,” he said with a big smile.
His father was an accountant, his mother a textile worker, and his grandfather, who lived with the family, was disabled from a work accident. The eldest child of five, he was left to handle the household while still in primary school.
“I tried to be a little leader of my siblings,” he said. “I never beat my brothers or sisters. I started to learn to cook when I was 9.”
He was still in high school when the chaos of the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, and like all students at the time, he was corralled to become a Red Guard. After a brief stint, he retreated to the countryside, a decade-long journey that left an indelible impression.
He joined the peasants in the fields during the day. At night, he studied at a makeshift desk forged from a discarded blackboard and four bamboo sticks. He devised a strict curriculum for himself, and devoted himself to mastering written and spoken English, via BBC radio.
At the end of the Cultural Revolution, he enrolled in the postgraduate English literature program at the Beijing Foreign Studies University in 1978.
There, he came under the wing of Prof. Wang Zuoliang, a dedicated teacher of English-language authors. When Mr. Wang returned from a trip to the Adelaide Festival in Australia in 1980, he encouraged Mr. Jin to translate “The Tree of Man,” a novel about man’s battle with nature by Patrick White, the 
.
China had just joined the World Bank. Because Mr. Jin was fluent in English, the Finance Ministry plucked him out of academia to join the office of the executive director for China at the World Bank in Washington. He had translated five chapters of White’s book, but dropped everything to serve his country.
The stint in Washington led to a career at the top echelons of China’s financial machinery: He was vice minister of finance, and later chairman of the supervisory board of the China Investment Corporation.
All the while he kept up his interest in things Western. In 1998, his daughter, Keyu, asked to leave home at 14 to live with an American family in New York and attend school there — a revolutionary idea for a Chinese family at the time. Mr. Jin’s experience abroad prepared him for sending his only child away, Keyu Jin said.
“My father was able to let me go,” said Ms. Jin, 33, now a tenured assistant professor of economics at the London School of Economics, and a popular figure on China’s social media. He set an example, she said, by always “reading and writing and listening to classical music after work. We never watched television.”

"MEXICO CITY — President Tsai Ing-wen of 
 has been hopscotching across Central America this week, attending the inauguration of Nicaragua’s president, Daniel Ortega, touring Guatemala’s colonial city of Antigua and visiting the shrine of Honduras’s patron saint.
From a global perspective, it is the sort of tour that looks like a diplomatic asterisk. But there is nothing trivial about it for Ms. Tsai, who is in Central America to shore up relationships amid increasing pressure from 
.
Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province, has diplomatic relations with only 20 countries, along with the Vatican; the largest cluster of those is in Latin America and the Caribbean. These relationships, complete with embassies, trade agreements and foreign aid, strengthen Taiwan’s effective sovereignty.
That is particularly important now for Taiwan, which fears becoming a casualty as President-elect Donald J. Trump threatens to roil the China-America relationship. Mr. Trump 
 from Ms. Tsai after his election, a break from protocol that prompted angry responses from China.
In a pointed message this week, China 
, and Ms. Tsai’s government responded by scrambling fighter jets over the waterway.
Maintaining the few formal relationships Taiwan has is an important source of domestic legitimacy for its leaders. If Taiwan is “not recognized by any country in the world — what good are you?” said Richard C. Bush, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
China has worked for decades to isolate Taiwan. Under the One China policy, Beijing demands that countries with which it has diplomatic relations drop their recognition of Taiwan. Since the United States established formal ties with China in 1979, most of the world has followed suit.
Central America is an outlier. In a quirk of diplomacy, all the countries of the region except Costa Rica still recognize Taiwan.
China poached Taiwan’s friendships for years, but it stopped while Ms. Tsai’s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, who advocated closer ties to China, was in office. New leaders in Panama, Paraguay and El Salvador all explored a switch, but China held them at bay.
“China can turn the screw whenever it wants,” said Colin Alexander, an assistant professor of political communications at Nottingham Trent University who wrote a book about the relationship between Taiwan and Central America.
After the election last January of Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence, China increased pressure on Taiwan, a democracy in which a majority of people do not want to be part of China. In her 
, Ms. Tsai said she wished to avoid confrontation.
But China responded bitterly to her call to Mr. Trump. Afterward, 
, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, broke relations with Taiwan. “One can see the Saõ Tomé switch as a signal from Beijing that ‘we have leverage,’” Mr. Bush said.
In light of the call, “it would not be surprising to see increasing efforts from Beijing (and concomitant response from Taiwan) to lure allies away,” Jonathan Sullivan, director of the China Policy Institute at the University of Nottingham, wrote in an email.
Since taking office in May, Ms. Tsai has been careful to cultivate those allies. In June, she visited Panama and then Paraguay, the only South American country that maintains relations with Taiwan. And the trip this week to four Central American allies is intended to keep them in the fold.
“The best outcome” of the trip “is that nothing happens,” Mr. Bush said.
One curious advantage of the Central American relationships for Ms. Tsai is that they allow her to make transit stops in the United States, asserting Taiwan’s presence even if she cannot participate in formal diplomatic meetings. On her way to Panama last summer, Ms. Tsai met with Senator Marco Rubio in Miami. Recently in Texas, she 
 and Gov. Greg Abbott on her way to Honduras.
Historically, the Central American countries, like others with formal ties to Taiwan, have found the arrangement favorable because Taiwan spent heavily to maintain them. But the money has sometimes ended up in the wrong hands. “Until the late 1990s, this was all about state bribery,” Mr. Alexander said.
Former President Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala admitted in United States Federal Court in 2014 that he had received $2.5 million in bribes from Taiwan between 1999 and 2002 — ostensibly intended to buy books for school libraries — in exchange for diplomatic recognition.
, Francisco Flores, a former president of El Salvador, was charged with channeling $10 million in donations from Taiwan for victims of a 2001 earthquake to his political party. An additional $5 million in donations also disappeared.
There is a darker side to the relationships, too, going back to the Cold War. In the 1970s, Taiwan trained Guatemalan and Salvadoran military officers involved in rights violations in brutal civil wars.
Taiwan has since ended its “checkbook diplomacy,” in a tacit acknowledgment that it could never outspend China. That has been clear in the Caribbean, where China has invested in expensive projects, sometimes in exchange for switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan.
Indeed, the other Central American countries have found that they can attract Chinese investment without normalizing diplomatic relations. They maintain informal business contacts.
“It’s all a kind of smoke and mirrors,” Mr. Alexander said. “The Central American republics have it pretty good. Taiwan treats them like a princess, and China is engaged in smart power and flexible diplomacy where it’s still willing to invest.”
China’s most grandiose investment in the region is a Chinese tycoon’s $50 billion plan to build 
, an opaque project with uncertain funding that stalled before work had begun. In Honduras, a Chinese company is building a dam on the Patuca River with funding from Chinese banks.
“As long as there is a fluid relationship between Taiwan and China, it’s a game they can continue to play,” said Enrique Dussel Peters, a China expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
But turbulence in that relationship could change the dynamic.
“There have been discussions in each of these countries about whether it makes sense to continue the relationship with Taiwan,” Mr. Dussel said.",Taiwan Works to Keep Its Central America Friends (Among Its Few),"JAN. 13, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/world/americas/taiwan-president-tsai-central-america-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,ELISABETH MALKIN
"BEIJING — The Chinese state news media lashed out at 
, President-elect Donald J. Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, on Friday, warning that his 
 it has constructed in the South China Sea could provoke a conflict.
Mr. Tillerson said during a confirmation hearing this week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that 
’s efforts to build islands in the sea and to equip some with military equipment were illegal, and he drew comparisons to 
.
State-run news outlets in China angrily denounced Mr. Tillerson’s remarks on Friday, vowing to counter any effort by the United States to intervene in the strategically significant waterway, which Beijing argues has been its territory since ancient times.
Global Times, a newspaper that often adopts a nationalistic tone, warned in an editorial that the United States 
 if it tried to block China from the islands.
“China has enough determination and strength to make sure that his rabble-rousing will not succeed,” the editorial said, referring to Mr. Tillerson.
China Daily, a state-run, English-language newspaper, said in an editorial that the nominee’s remarks were “
 because they are a mishmash of naïveté, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices and unrealistic political fantasies.”
“Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous,” the editorial continued. “It would set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the U.S.”
The angry reaction to Mr. Tillerson’s remarks reflected the degree to which Chinese leaders see the island-building campaign as a matter of national sovereignty and a crucial part of efforts to become a global military superpower.
But the response also suggested that Chinese officials seek to stake out a tough position as they prepare to deal with Mr. Trump, who has criticized Chinese policies on trade and North Korea.
“China is looking to heighten the threat of conflict,” said Anders Corr, principal of 
, a research organization based in New York. “They’re basically doing that to try to intimidate U.S. political and economic actors, and influence their decision making around issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea.”
Mr. Corr added that Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees, through their harsh words, also sought a strong hand in negotiations.
Still, many analysts in China reacted with alarm to the remarks by Mr. Tillerson, who recently stepped down as chief executive of Exxon Mobil. He said that the United States would need to “send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops.” He added, referring to China, “Your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.”
Over the past several years, China has dredged sand to turn scattered 
 reefs and atolls into islands — totaling roughly 3,000 acres — despite protests from neighbors and from the United States. An international tribunal 
 in the sea last year, but Chinese leaders have pressed forward with construction.
The Obama administration has dispatched warships near the artificial islands, in what it calls an attempt to uphold freedom of navigation in the sea, an important economic and strategic waterway that is believed to be rich in 
 and gas. But American officials have so far stopped short of threatening to block China’s access to the islands.
Carlyle A. Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said that such a move would be akin to President John F. Kennedy’s ordering a blockade of Cuba during the 
.
“Tillerson’s proposal would provoke a serious confrontation that could quickly develop into armed conflict,” he said.
Some Chinese analysts said Mr. Tillerson’s remarks were an indication that the United States would continue to seek a robust presence in Asia, despite Mr. Trump’s pledges to focus on domestic issues.
Su Hao, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, said that such a move by Washington would draw resistance from China and other nations in the region.
“China will not adjust its policy regarding the South China Sea,” Mr. Su said in a telephone interview. “We will continue to do things that are in line with our own national interests and our own logic.”",Chinese State Media Denounce Rex Tillerson’s Call to Block Island Access,"JAN. 13, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/world/asia/rex-tillerson-south-china-sea.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JAVIER C.

"Zhou Youguang, known as the father of Pinyin for creating the system of Romanized Chinese writing that has become the international standard since its introduction some 60 years ago, died on Saturday in Beijing, Chinese state media reported. He was 111.
In recent decades, with the comparative invincibility that he felt great age bestowed on him, Mr. Zhou was also an outspoken critic of the Chinese government.
“What are they going to do,” he asked bluntly in an interview with the BBC in 2012. “Come and take me away?”
In fact, they had already done that once before, long ago.
Adopted by 
 in 1958, Pinyin was designed not to replace the tens of thousands of traditional characters with which Chinese is written, but as an orthographic pry bar to afford passage into the labyrinthine world of those characters.
Since then, Pinyin (the name can be translated as “spelled sounds”) has vastly increased literacy throughout the country; eased the classroom agonies of foreigners studying Chinese; afforded the blind a way to read the language in Braille; and, in a development Mr. Zhou could scarcely have foreseen, facilitated the rapid entry of Chinese on computer keyboards and cellphones.
It is to Pinyin that we owe now-ubiquitous spellings like Beijing, which supplanted the earlier Peking; Chongqing, which replaced Chungking; Mao Zedong instead of Mao Tse-tung; and thousands of others. The system was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in 1982 and by the United Nations in 1986.
Yet for all Mr. Zhou’s linguistic influence, his late-life political opposition — in 2015, the news agency Agence France-Presse called him “probably China’s oldest dissenter” — ensured that he remained relatively obscure in his own country.
“Within China, he remains largely uncelebrated,” The New York Times wrote in 2012. “As the state-run China Daily newspaper remarked in 2009, he should be a household name but is virtually unknown.”
It took Mr. Zhou and his colleagues three years to develop Pinyin, but the most striking thing about his involvement was that he was neither a linguist nor a lexicographer but an economist, recently returned to China from Wall Street.
But because of a fortuitous meeting at midcentury, and a lifetime love of language, he was conscripted by the Chinese government to develop an accessible alphabetic writing system. It was a turn of fate, Mr. Zhou acknowledged afterward, that may well have saved his life.
The son of a prominent family (his father was an official of China’s last imperial dynasty, the Qing, which endured continuously from the 17th century until 1912), Mr. Zhou was born in Changzhou, in eastern China, on Jan. 13, 1906. His name at birth was Zhou Yaoping; he adopted the pen name Zhou Youguang as an adult.
In 1927, after studying at St. John’s University in Shanghai, he graduated from Guanghua University there with a degree in economics.
At the start of the second Sino-Japanese war, precipitated by Japan’s invasion of China in 1937, Mr. Zhou moved with his wife, Zhang Yunhe, and two young children to Chongqing, the wartime capital. Their daughter, Zhou Xiaohe, died there of appendicitis.
In Chongqing, Mr. Zhou worked for the Sin Hua Trust and Savings Bank. He also made the acquaintance of Zhou Enlai, already a star in the Communist Party, who would serve as China’s premier from 1949 to 1976.
Although Zhou Youguang never joined the party, that acquaintance would lead directly to his development of Pinyin.
In 1946, Mr. Zhou went to New York to represent Sin Hua at the Wall Street headquarters of its United States agent, Irving Trust. He remained for three years, until the Communist takeover of China in 1949 moved him to return home.
“We all thought that China had a very good opportunity to develop; we didn’t expect the later turmoil,” Mr. Zhou told The Guardian, the British newspaper, in 2008. “History misled us.”
For the next few years he taught economics at Fudan University in Shanghai until, in the mid-1950s, Zhou Enlai intervened.
By then the Communist government was seeking to make Mandarin Chinese the national language and to boost literacy throughout the country. In 1955, it convened a committee to create an alphabetic system, based on Mandarin, that would be easier to use than existing Romanization systems.
Knowing that linguistics was a hobby of Mr. Zhou’s, Zhou Enlai drafted him to come to Beijing and lead the committee. Mr. Zhou’s protests that he was a mere amateur were to no avail.
“Everyone is an amateur,” he was told.
So he set about studying languages, and the myriad systems used to write them down. Before long, amid the late-1950s purges of rightists by Mao Zedong, the Communist Party chairman, he came to realize that his new calling was literally lifesaving.
“Mao disliked greatly the economists — especially economic professors from America,” Mr. Zhou told The Guardian. “By that time I had shifted to the line of language and writing. I was not considered a rightist. Very lucky. If I had remained in Shanghai teaching economics I think I certainly could have been imprisoned for 20 years. A good friend of mine was imprisoned and committed suicide.”
In attempting to devise an alphabetic system with which to transliterate Chinese, Mr. Zhou was continuing an orthographic tradition that went back at least to the 16th century.
Traditional Chinese writing, conceived more than two thousand years ago, is a logographic system, in which each word of the language is represented by a separate character. To the reader, each character conveys mainly semantic, rather than phonetic, information.
This fact gives Chinese writing an inherent advantage: It can be used as a common system with which to write the country’s many mutually unintelligible dialects. Thus, speakers of dialects as divergent as Mandarin and Cantonese can communicate with one another in writing, with each character encoding the same meaning — “house,” “blue,” “think,” and so on — regardless of its pronunciation in any one dialect.
But by the same token, such a system carries a great disadvantage: Because the characters disclose little phonetic information, it is not possible, without prior knowledge, to look at a Chinese word and know how to pronounce it.
For readers, there is also the immense onus of needing to master thousands upon thousands of discrete characters to attain even basic literacy: Compare the mere two dozen or so characters that users of alphabets have to learn.
“Pinyin is not to replace Chinese characters; it is a help to Chinese characters,” Mr. Zhou explained in the interview with The Guardian. “Without an alphabet you had to learn mouth to mouth, ear to ear.”
As a result, illiteracy remained rampant throughout China well into the 20th century — affecting, by some estimates, as much as 85 percent of the population. It was also inordinately hard for foreigners to learn to read the language.
Other Romanization systems had been tried before, beginning with one developed in the late 1500s by Jesuit missionaries from Europe. Until the advent of Pinyin, the most prevalent system was Wade-Giles, the work of two British diplomats in the late 19th century.
But the Wade-Giles system, linguists have long agreed, is unwieldy and inaccurate. It employs a cumbersome set of numbered superscripts to indicate Chinese tones — the meaningful variations in pitch that distinguish many words in the language. Nor does it reflect Mandarin pronunciation especially faithfully.
At the start, Mr. Zhou and his committee confronted a set of foundational questions: Should Pinyin employ the Roman alphabet, the Cyrillic or a purpose-built one? How should it indicate the tones of the language?
Though China’s close alliance with the Soviet Union made Cyrillic seductive, the committee ultimately settled on Roman because of its worldwide prevalence. Simple diacritical marks, including acute and grave accents, were used to represent tones.
Adopted by the Chinese government on Feb. 11, 1958, Pinyin met with rapid acclaim. But even that could not spare Mr. Zhou during the Cultural Revolution, Mao’s purge of intellectuals and others between 1966 and 1976, in which tens of millions died.
In 1969, the government labeled Mr. Zhou a “reactionary academic authority” and exiled him to a labor camp in the Ningxia region of north-central China, where he worked the rice fields. He spent more than two years there.
On returning home, he continued writing about language, culture and contemporary affairs. In the 1980s, he helped oversee the translation into Chinese of the Encyclopedia Britannica.
Mr. Zhou was the author of more than 40 books, some of them banned in China and a good 10 of them published after he turned 100.
In his occasional interviews with the Western news media from his modest apartment in Beijing, Mr. Zhou was openly critical both of revolutionary-era Chinese Communism (“In all honesty I haven’t got anything good to say about Mao Zedong,” he told Agence France-Presse in 2015) and of the economic reforms of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping.
“Chinese people becoming rich isn’t important,” he said in the same interview. “Human progress is ultimately progress towards democracy.”
Mr. Zhou died at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, according to Beijing News and other Chinese state-run news media outlets. Mr. Zhou’s wife died in 2002. Their son, Zhou Xiaoping, an astrophysicist, died in 2015.
Today, Pinyin is used by hundreds of millions of people in China alone. Schoolchildren there first learn to read by means of the system before graduating to the study of characters.
As a result, the country’s illiteracy rate today is about 5 percent, according to Unicef. Pinyin is also part of the standard pedagogy for foreign students of Chinese around the world.
In the interview with Agence France-Presse in 2015, Mr. Zhou articulated the philosophy that he said sustained him through his years in the labor camp. It seems a fitting ethos for his long life as a whole.

"HONG KONG — In the clearest sign yet that China’s government has begun a new push to solidify control over mobile apps, a regulator has ordered the registration of app stores across the country.
In a 
 published on its website, the Cyberspace Administration of China said late Friday that its offices across China should ensure that records are kept on the country’s many app stores, starting Monday.
“Many apps have been found to spread illegal information, violate user rights or contain security risks,” the post read. It said the purpose of the registration was to ensure that it is clear who takes responsibility if apps, or app stores, are found to engage in illegal practices.
Beijing has begun pushing harder to enforce a law passed last year that barred apps from engaging in activities deemed to endanger national security or disrupt social order, terms that are often broadly applied to discussion of politically sensitive topics.
Just three weeks ago, 
 from its China app store. Apple said the government had told it that the apps violated local regulations, but the company declined to specify which regulations.
While the Chinese authorities have long maintained tight controls over the internet, smartphone apps have presented new challenges.
Because Google’s store for apps using its Android operating system is blocked in China, a large number of third-party stores have arisen to take its place. Most of China’s biggest app stores are controlled by its largest internet and smartphone companies, including Tencent, Baidu, Qihoo 360, Xiaomi and Alibaba.
The profusion of third-party stores has led to multiple versions of apps and low security standards on the sites where they are commonly downloaded, according to analysts.
Government monitoring of content and discussions can also be more difficult on mobile apps than on websites. Content that would be strictly blocked on the internet can often be found on Chinese apps, though the authorities have occasionally banned apps that hosted such content.
As with many Chinese laws and government orders, the notice posted Friday is vague, but it does appear to place some responsibility for policing apps’ activity on the app stores themselves.
It is also significant because it indicates that the regulator is taking concrete steps to follow up on 
.
Chinese laws are often intentionally broad and open-ended to allow regulators discretion in enforcing them. For that reason, concrete steps like the registrations ordered Friday can provide the first indication of how laws will be carried out in practice.
While the impact the order will have on China’s mobile internet is not clear, it could ultimately lead to a culling of apps that store owners are uncomfortable with, including ones from foreign companies, which could be more difficult to identify or rein in.
Still, it may take years for the government to exert control over all the app stores in the country. Carrying out such edicts is often a slow process; for example, efforts to ensure that online profiles are linked to the user’s real name have been continuing for more than a decade.",China Orders Registration of App Stores,"JAN. 14, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/business/china-orders-registration-of-app-stores.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PAUL MOZUR
"CHENGDU, China — 
that a revolution was not a dinner party. But with the communist revolution turning into opulent capitalism, China’s rich are now making sure the dinner party settings are immaculate and the wine is poured just right.
Inspired in part by the “Downton Abbey” television drama, the country’s once raw and raucous tycoons are aspiring to old-school decorum, fueling demand for the services of homegrown butlers trained in the ways of a British manor.
“What they would like to say to their friends is, ‘Look, I have a butler, an English-style butler in my home,’ to show how wealthy they are,” said 
, a Chinese-born Briton living in Beijing, who for over a decade has helped train and find jobs for butlers.
“The country now with the biggest trend in butlers is China,” said Mr. Yeh, whose English accent would be at home on “Downton Abbey,” the television series about a blue blood family in England, which was 
. “I dare say I have played a part in starting this trend.”
Butler training schools and agencies have been doing business in China for more than a decade, but the number of recruits has grown sharply in recent years, according to those in the business. Most are Chinese and many are women. The 
 opened in 2014 here in Chengdu, a haze-covered city in southwest China, and offers a six-week boot camp on dinner service, managing homes and other minutiae of high living.
“The Chinese are vacationing more now than ever in history, and so they’re being exposed to the West more and more,” said Christopher Noble, an American trainer at the academy who previously 
. “But Chinese people see that, experience top-class personal service abroad, and they want to experience it here.”
A boom in butler service might seem incongruous as President Xi Jinping campaigns zealously against 
, and an economic 
 undercuts lavish spending. But China’s rich continue amassing ever greater fortunes and want what they see as the trappings of respectable refinement. Even under Mr. Xi, butlers are finding growing work as symbols of good taste, according to people in the business.
“You read about an economic slowdown, but China’s wealth is still growing,” said Luo Jinhuan, who has worked as a butler in Shanghai and, most recently, Beijing, after learning the job in Holland. “Old money has passed from one generation to the next. But the new money doesn’t have the same quality. You need to help them improve.”
If butlers symbolize maturing Chinese capitalism, the somewhat awkward status they have here also reflects how the rich in China must play by different rules than the wealthy in many other countries.
It often comes down to a lack of trust. Wealth in China, where a cutthroat business culture is pervasive, comes with insecurity about being brought low by resentful employees, rivals, and officials, especially with the continuing crackdown against corruption. That wariness discourages many millionaires from hiring their own Jeeves to run their homes, people in the business said.
“Some of them discover that in reality they can’t trust an outsider to manage the household,” said Tang Yang, a marketing director at the butler academy. “They’re unwilling to have a butler who knows all the information about the family.”
Relatively few graduates of the academy end up as traditional household butlers. Instead, many work in high-end clubs, housing estates and executive floors, serving several clients at the same time — not with the same intimacy as a personal butler.
Promoters of butlers in China often point out that the country has its own tradition of high-end service, and the classical Chinese novel, “Dream of the Red Chamber,” features traditional butlers, called “guanjia,” or “domestic manager,” in Mandarin. But “Downton Abbey” helped rekindle a new romanticized interest in old-school service in China.
Many student butlers here said they had watched and rewatched the show as an instruction video on the self-effacing unflappability of domestic service.
“I only began to grasp this profession of butlers after watching ‘Downton Abbey,’” said Xu Shitao, a 34-year-old Beijing native studying at the Chengdu academy. “I think that in the future this profession will be quite popular and will have a market.”
But Ms. Xu and her classmates have found that, in reality, being a butler is strenuous work.
On a recent morning, they practiced for hours, learning to serve wine and water the proper way. Again and again, the class of eight clasped a wine bottle near its bottom and stepped forward in unison around a dinner table to dispense just enough wine to reach the widest part of a wine glass.
Not a drop was to splash the tablecloth or, heaven forbid, a guest.
“Stretch, pour, up, twist, back, wipe. Try to extend your arm,” Mr. Noble commanded, using his ever-present translator. “You want to be able to extend your arm as much as possible. You’re doing a ballet.”
Students also take classes on serving formal dinners, packing luggage, cleaning house and countless other details of managing life for the rich.
“You have to get the details right to do your job right,” said Yang Linjun, a 22-year-old student in the class. “Your arms get sore and your hands hurt, but this is a lifestyle.”
After they graduate, many hope to attach themselves to China’s growing number of superrich. In return, they may earn monthly wages of $2,800 or much higher as personal butlers, depending on experience and luck — more than for many service jobs.
By 2015, China had 400 billionaires and billionaire families, an increase of 65 from just a year earlier, according to 
. The country’s richest 1 percent 
 of household wealth, a share similar to the concentration of wealth in America.
Manners can be rough in China, sometimes in a warm way, sometimes less so. But that has been changing as people grow richer, travel and live abroad, and bring back a demand for polished, attentive service.
“A decade ago, very few Chinese people stayed in five-star hotels,” said Yang Kaojun, a property manager with the 
, which employs teams of trained butlers who are at the beck and call of residents. “But now many people have, and that’s given them some understanding of what good service is.”
As well as the Chengdu academy, the Sanda University, a private college in Shanghai, has 
 into its hospitality program. Many Chinese also learn how to be butlers in Europe. And Sara Vestin Rahmani, the founder of the Bespoke Bureau, a British company that finds domestic staff members for wealthy employers, said her company planned to open a school for butlers and domestic staff people in China this year.
The number of butlers in China is hard to determine. There may be hundreds or thousands, especially in Beijing, Shanghai and the prosperous south. Ms. Rahmani said that in 2007 her company found positions in China for 20 butlers; by 2015 that number had grown to 375, including 125 with families. Others reported similar growth.
“We are in actual fact exporting to China a trade which was once their own,” Ms. Rahmani said. “With communism, everything that was refined, unique and upper-class became a distant memory.”
But Chinese employers often treat butlers as expensive all-purpose flunkies who should be on call 24 hours a day. That violated the traditional idea of a butler as a respected manager of the household and above most menial tasks. Ms. Luo, the butler, said her work was far more hectic than she imagined. Her daily routine included overseeing the sauna, cinema, bowling alley and other rooms in a 32,000-square-foot home.
“I feel that when work starts, there’s no time at all to stop and rest,” she said. “It’s a lot harder than working in a hotel.”
The pressure is compounded by employers’ fears that household servants could exploit sensitive information. Butlers are supposed to have a deep knowledge of their employers’ every foible, traditionally recorded in a book. But the worry that information could be used to rob, extort or prosecute them has discouraged many rich people from taking butlers into their confidence.
“Many of our wealthy are the first generation to be rich, and they don’t have a long accumulation of family history,” said Mr. Yang, the student at the butler academy in Chengdu, who works for a real estate company. “You need trust and a long period of adjustment to have another person suddenly by your side.”","Rich Chinese, Inspired by ‘Downton,’ Fuel Demand for Butlers","JAN. 14, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/world/asia/rich-chinese-inspired-by-downton-fuel-demand-for-butlers.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"As if 
’s victory wasn’t surprising enough, the economic reaction has been even more stunning. Despite forecasts of a stock market meltdown if he won, the market registered one of its strongest postelection rallies in more than a century. Now the euphoria is spilling into the wider economy, with business confidence skyrocketing and consumer confidence hitting a 15-year high. Much of this excitement is inspired by a growing consensus that Mr. Trump could be the most-business friendly president since Ronald Reagan.
Indeed Mr. Trump’s advisers say that over the next decade, their plans for tax cuts and deregulation could push the average annual growth rate back up to 3.5 percent — the same as during the Reagan presidency. Mr. Trump says the country can grow even faster. His backers dismiss skeptics as defeatists and have insisted there is “no law of nature or economics” that would prevent the United States from reviving the boom of the 1980s.
Only there is such a law. The forces that underlie economic growth have weakened significantly since the Reagan years, worldwide. No nation, no matter how exceptional, can try to grow faster than economic forces allow without the risk of provoking a volatile boom-bust cycle.
The potential growth rate of an economy is roughly determined — and limited — by the sum of two factors: population and productivity. An economy can grow steadily only by adding more workers, or by increasing output per worker. During the Reagan years, both population and productivity were growing at around 1.7 percent a year, so the potential United States growth rate was close to 3.5 percent. In short, Reagan did not push the nation’s economic engine to run faster than it could handle.
When Mr. Trump and his advisers promise to make America great again, they are in effect envisioning Reagan 2.0, while overlooking how much has changed. In recent years, America’s population and productivity growth have fallen to around .75 percent each, generously measured, so potential economic growth is roughly 1.5 percent, less than half the rate of the Reagan era. Any policy package that aims to push an economy beyond its potential could easily backfire — in the form of higher deficits and inflation.
The population and productivity formula is well known and undisputed — yet widely ignored amid the current euphoria.
In the last 1,000 years, no economy has ever broken free of the limits imposed by population growth. Before the late 19th century, global population growth did not exceed half a percent, and global economic growth did not exceed 1 percent for any sustained period. Before World War II, population growth increased to 1 percent, and economic growth accelerated to about 2 percent. After the war, the baby boom pushed population growth toward 2 percent, and economic growth rose to nearly 4 percent for the first and only time in world history.
Now, as families around the world have fewer children, global population growth has fallen to about 1 percent. The baby boom has gone bust, and the best any nation can do is contain the economic damage. With the United States population growth rate falling — last year to the slowest rate recorded since the 1930s — it is extremely unlikely that any president could juice the economy to grow at a steady 3.5 percent or more over the next decade.
Slow population growth undermines the economy by delivering fewer young people into the work force. Nations can partly compensate by raising the retirement age or admitting more immigrant workers. Mr. Trump, however, has no such plans. His advisers focus instead on bringing back the many American workers who have given up on finding jobs and dropped out of the labor force. But this strategy can have only limited effect. The main reason fewer workers participate in the nation’s labor force is not that they are discouraged, but that they are over 55, the age when many people stop working or work less.
In general, commentators who believe the United States can go back to the 1980s focus not on population but on productivity. They argue that Reagan-style tax cuts and deregulation can increase investment in new plants and equipment, and substantially raise output per worker. But productivity is much harder to measure and forecast than population.
Rather than enter that foggy debate, then, let’s assume Mr. Trump’s team can more than double United States productivity growth to the rate achieved in the Reagan era, 1.7 percent. Given the irreversible fact of slowing population growth, that productivity miracle would still raise the potential growth rate of the domestic economy to only around 2.5 percent. If that doesn’t sound so different from 3.5 percent, consider that every percentage point of growth in the domestic economy is worth more than $100 billion — the difference between feeling pretty good and Great Again.
The nub of the problem here is nostalgia for a bygone era. The postwar world grew accustomed to the rapid growth made possible by the baby boom. Not every country with rapid population growth enjoyed a steady economic boom, but few economies boomed without it. And for most countries, the era of population growth is now over.
The pressure of falling population growth means that every class of countries needs to adopt a new math of economic success, and bring its definition of strong growth down by a full point or more. For developed nations like the United States, with average incomes over $25,000, any rate above 1.5 percent should be seen as relatively good.
Comparing United States growth unfavorably to China’s, as Mr. Trump has, makes little sense because poorer countries always tend to grow faster. If your starting income is lower, it’s much easier to double it. But slowing population growth is also weighing on countries in China’s income class, and for them the baseline for economic success should also be revised downward, to around 4 percent.
The risks of excessive ambition are real. In recent years the actual growth rate of the United States economy has been about 2 percent, which is disappointing in comparison with the 1980s, but far from horrible, given its diminished potential. Often, if a country pushes the economy to grow much faster than its potential, it will start to suffer from rising debts and deficits. Inflation will rise, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates aggressively, which can prompt a recession. This risk is particularly high at a time, like the present, when the United States is already running the largest deficit ever recorded at this stage of an economic expansion.
It will be difficult to persuade people to accept the reality of slower growth. Voters in many countries are already turning to populists who are promising miracles and attempting nationalist economic experiments. The coming era is likely to bring more such experimentation and diversion, but the new math of slower growth will remain.",Why Trump Can’t Make It 1981 Again,"JAN. 14, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/opinion/sunday/why-trump-cant-make-it-1981-again.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,RUCHIR SHARMA
"JIUQUAN, China — On the edge of the Gobi Desert, the Jiuquan Wind Power Base stands as a symbol of 
’s quest to dominate the world’s renewable energy market. With more than 7,000 turbines arranged in rows that stretch along the sandy horizon, it is one of the world’s largest 
, capable of generating enough electricity to power a small country.
But these days, the windmills loom like scarecrows, idle and inert. The wind howls outside, but many turbines in Jiuquan, a city of vast deserts and farms in the northwest province of Gansu, have been shut off because of weak demand. Workers while away the hours calculating how much power the turbines could have generated if there were more buyers, and wondering if and when they will ever make a profit.
“There’s not much we can do right now,” said Zhou Shenggang, a manager at a state-owned energy company who oversees 134 turbines here; about 60 percent of their capacity goes unused each year. “Only the state can intervene.”
China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has pointed to its embrace of wind and 
 and other alternatives to coal to position itself at the forefront of the global effort to combat 
.
More than 92,000 wind turbines have been built across the country, capable of generating 145 gigawatts of electricity, nearly double the capacity of wind farms in the United States. One out of every three turbines in the world is now in China, and the government is adding them at a rate of more than 
.
But some of its most ambitious wind projects are underused. Many are grappling with a nationwide economic slowdown that has dampened demand for electricity. Others are stymied by persistent favoritism toward the coal industry by local officials and a dearth of transmission lines to carry electricity from rural areas in the north and west to China’s fastest-growing cities.
That has left China unable to generate enough renewable energy to make a serious dent in air pollution and carbon emissions, despite the state-driven building spree. Even with its unmatched arsenal of turbines, China still lags the United States. Wind power now accounts for 3.3 percent of electricity generation in China, according to the nation’s National Energy Administration, compared with 4.7 percent in the United States.
Chinese officials have described the challenges facing the wind sector as growing pains, and they say the investments in renewable energy will pay off in the long term. The costs of wind projects are falling rapidly with advances in technology and more efficient construction, making them more competitive with plants powered by fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.
And the government has vowed to continue investing heavily in renewable energy. It said this month that it intended to spend 
 through 2020 on developing renewable energy sources.
Analysts said that China’s success would depend on its ability to overcome both political and practical obstacles, including resistance to renewable energy from local governments and a lack of turbines near major cities.
“This is partly a political fight,” said Paolo Frankl, head of the renewable energy division at the International Energy Agency. “Still, it’s a very, very robust and solid trajectory.”
Sebastian Meyer, research and advisory director at Azure International, a renewable-energy consulting firm in Beijing, said China was “leapfrogging everybody” with its investments in renewable energy but needed to push through painful policy decisions, such as allowing more flexibility in setting energy prices.
“For years, they’ve been talking about power-sector reform,” he said. “But really they need a different market approach that incentivizes more use of renewables going forward.”
The Jiuquan Wind Power Base, approved by the government in 2008, epitomized China’s ambition to become a global leader in clean energy. The government vowed to invest $17.4 billion by 2020 and build a vast farm capable of generating 20 gigawatts of power, more than the combined wind capacity of several countries.
But the unfinished project has been slow to take off, even as the government continues to build it out.
Part of the problem is the location. Gansu is a barren, mountainous province, chosen for its strong winds and potential for growth. But it is far from the booming cities of eastern China, making transmission of electricity difficult.
Gansu now has some of the highest rates of underutilization in the wind sector in China; in 2015, 39 percent of wind capacity in the province was wasted, according to statistics compiled by the National Energy Administration.
Mr. Frankl said inefficiency in Gansu was “astronomically high” and underscored the need for China to build more ultrahigh-voltage transmission lines to carry electricity long distances, and to position new turbines closer to major metropolises.
In Gansu and elsewhere, the central government has also run up against 
. Advocates for the wind industry contend that local officials have reduced production quotas for wind farms to give an advantage to coal companies.
, a major driver of economic growth in many provinces, wields significant influence in China. While the government has pledged to curb the spread of coal plants as part of its plan to make 20 percent of China’s energy renewable by 2030, it has 
 in some places.
“The cake is only so big,” said Yan Jing, a Greenpeace activist in Beijing who studies climate change and energy issues. “It’s hard for new energy companies to take a slice from traditional players.”
Even if more transmission lines were constructed, Ms. Yan said, the government would have trouble persuading businesses along China’s heavily developed eastern coast to buy electricity from faraway provinces.
“The authorities failed to consider the demand factor, namely, ‘How can we get closer to buyers?’” she said. “There should be more development of clean energy in eastern parts of China so electricity can be absorbed locally.”
In introducing a new energy plan last week, officials acknowledged that the focus on building turbines far from urban centers had 
. He Yongjian, an official at the National Energy Administration, said the government would now build a majority of new turbines in the east, partly to reduce the need to transmit power long distances.
But building wind farms in the east might be difficult, given the preponderance of coal plants, a lack of strong winds and a scarcity of undeveloped land.
The tepid demand for electricity in an economic downturn has also exacerbated the troubles for renewable energy. Demand for electricity grew by only 0.5 percent in 2015, the slowest rate of growth since 1974, and it is expected to remain weak until consumer spending picks up.
At the Jiuquan Wind Power Base, Mr. Zhou oversees a small wind farm for a branch of China Resources Power Holdings, a state-run energy company based in Shenzhen that operates two wind farms in Gansu. He said the wind industry’s problems had hurt morale and productivity. The branch in Jiuquan has made small cuts in salaries and benefits for its 32 employees because of its challenges in selling electricity. Other wind farms in the area have resorted to layoffs, according to interviews with workers.
Outside the company’s offices, a walled compound along a desert highway, trucks carrying coal rumbled down dusty roads. Mr. Zhou, wearing a bumblebee-yellow uniform and fiddling with a pencil, surveyed the vast stretch of immobile turbines from his desk.
“The only thing I can do is encourage my employees to do a good job,” he said. “I assure them that over the long term, the new energy sector is very promising. The difficulties right now are only temporary.”",It Can Power a Small Nation.

"He called NATO obsolete. He said Germany’s acceptance of refugees is “utterly catastrophic.” The decades-old One China policy embraced by the United States? That’s up for discussion. Just days before Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, world leaders on three continents are on edge after comments the president-elect made in an interview on Friday with 
 and in 
, Bild and The Times of London.
 Mr. Trump said, according to the German newspaper Bild. The 28-member alliance, born in 1949, three years after Mr. Trump, is viewed by many — including his nominee for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis — as essential to American security.
“Secondly, countries aren’t paying what they should” 
Responding on Monday to Mr. Trump’s comments, Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined NATO in 2004, urged Mr. Trump to continue meeting the United States’ financial obligations toward the alliance.
Mr. Trump also criticized the European Union, describing it as “basically a vehicle for Germany.” He praised Britain for its 
, known as Brexit, adding: “I believe others will leave. I do think keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think.”
French leaders also bristled at Mr. Trump’s swipe against the bloc. Their response comes as they deal with growing domestic support for the anti-European Union and anti-immigrant party National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, 
 in New York.
“The best response,” said the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, “is European unity.”
In the interview with The Journal, Mr. Trump said the One China policy was up for negotiation. Beijing responded quickly and decisively.
Its Foreign Ministry called the policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole Chinese government, the foundation of China-United States ties, and it said it was nonnegotiable. People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the governing Communist Party, said Mr. Trump “has been stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the job, though he speaks like a rookie.”
An unusually

“If Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as 
 the newspaper said.
A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Mr. Trump on Monday that any effort to undermine the policy could backfire.

“It would be a problem for the entire world,” Mr. Guajardo Villarreal warned.
Such a tariff “will have a wave of impacts that can take us into a global recession,” he said.
Not surprisingly, Russian diplomats were unperturbed by Mr. Trump’s comments on NATO. They welcomed the “obsolete” label and were enthusiastic at his suggestion that he would consider reducing sanctions against Russia if the country agreed to reduce its nuclear arsenal.

"When spring arrives in 
, few things are as loathed as the fuzzy, flamboyant poplar trees.
They were planted by the millions in Chairman Mao’s day as a quick and cheap way to bring greenery to landscapes across China that were devastated by poverty and strife.
Now they are everywhere, growing like mad and making a major nuisance of themselves. “We can’t control them any more,” said Che Shaochen, a senior researcher at the Beijing Forestry Sciences Institute.
Here’s the trouble: Every spring, the female poplar trees and their willow tree cousins blanket the streets of Chinese cities with cottonlike balls of fluff known as catkins. They get into everything, clogging car radiators and irritating people’s eyes. In some places they come down so thickly that they can disrupt traffic and even cause fires.
In Beijing, the capital, which has one poplar tree for about every 10 people, the municipal government has begun to fight back with a campaign to eliminate the fuzz once and for all.
Officials have dispatched teams to hose down and prune thousands of trees and to inject a chemical known as birth control into trees to stop them from emitting the fuzz.
The worst offenders have even been given sex-change operations of a sort: Arborists graft segments of male trees onto the female trunks.
Residents of China’s smog-choked metropolises long ago grew accustomed to dealing with stubborn air pollutants. But in the springtime, nothing irks them quite like the catkins, especially when they drop uninvited into a steaming bowl of soup or suddenly swirl in the air, blocking visibility like a bad snowstorm.
Chen Jimen, 43, a street sweeper who works near the Forbidden City, estimates that during the peak season he sweeps up a whole trash can’s worth of catkins every day.
Liu Yingjie, 41, a taxi driver, said he had mastered the routine of regularly blasting the catkins off his car’s engine. “They entirely block your line of sight,” he said.
Zhang Weiming, 27, a banker, said he stayed indoors when the catkins were in full force. “They get into your eyes and your mouth,” he said. “I never want to go outside.”",China’s Poplar Trees: A Spring Nuisance That Snows White Fluff,"JAN. 16, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/world/what-in-the-world/chinese-metropolises-springtime-foe-the-poplar-tree.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JAVIER C.

"HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s richest man has taken a step closer to winning control of a big Australian energy company, as he seeks to overcome Australia’s occasional wariness toward foreign investors from China.
Companies controlled by Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, on Monday announced a sweetened deal worth 7.4 billion Australian dollars, or about $5.5 billion, for control of the Sydney-listed Duet Group, which operates natural gas pipelines and electricity distribution companies in the states of Western Australia and Victoria.
The

. It also won unanimous support from Duet’s board of directors, who described it in 
 as “fair and reasonable and in the best interests of Duet security holders.”
Although Chinese demand for iron ore and agricultural products remains a major driver of the Australian economy, investment from China or China-linked sources can still be regarded as suspect by the Australian government. Local would-be home buyers in big cities like Sydney and Melbourne bemoan soaring property prices, which they attribute in part to an influx of wealthy Chinese.
Recent indications suggest Australia’s wariness of Chinese money is on the rise.
In August, the Australian government cited national security concerns when 
 competing, separate bids from a group of Mr. Li’s publicly listed companies and the State Grid Corporation of China, which is owned by Beijing. The rival bidders had sought control of Ausgrid, a company that supplies electricity to Sydney and neighboring areas.
Australia’s foreign investment laws require the national treasurer to sign off on major acquisitions by overseas buyers. Describing the Hong Kong and mainland China bids as “contrary to the national interest,” the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said at the time that “national security issues were identified in critical power and communications services that Ausgrid provides to businesses and governments.”

"HONG KONG — Almost three years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, officials said on Tuesday that they had called off the underwater search for the plane, ensuring that one of the great aviation mysteries will remain unsolved for the foreseeable future.
The decision, which had been expected, indefinitely suspends 
 in the southern Indian Ocean for 
, a Boeing 777. The underwater search turned up no traces of the aircraft, although pieces of debris were found as far away as Tanzania.
Flight 370 
 from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to Beijing on March 8, 2014, prompting the largest and costliest search in aviation history. Investigators determined that the plane veered off course and flew south for several hours, for reasons that remain unknown.
“Today the last search vessel has left the underwater search area,” the governments of 
, China and Malaysia, the three countries that oversaw the search, said in a joint statement on Tuesday. “Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has not been located in the 120,000-square-kilometer underwater search area in the southern Indian Ocean,” a zone of more than 46,000 square miles.
“Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting-edge technology, as well as modeling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” the statement said. “Accordingly, the underwater search for MH370 has been suspended.”
At a news conference in Sydney on Wednesday, Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said, “We grieve with the families of the victims and we share their deep disappointment that the plane has not been found.”
“There has been a massive search. It is an unprecedented search,” Mr. Turnbull added. “It has been conducted with the best advice over the areas that were identified as the most likely to find the location of the airplane.”
The decision drew sharp rebukes from relatives of the missing.
“It is incomprehensible that they would give up right now,” a sobbing Grace Nathan, 28, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the flight, said in a telephone interview from Kuala Lumpur. “I can’t imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air.”
Investigators have 
 about what happened. They believe that the plane ran out of fuel, and one theory holds that the pilots tried to make an emergency landing at sea. It has also been suggested that one or both pilots lost control of the aircraft, that one was a rogue pilot, or that the plane was hijacked.
What investigators do know from radar and satellite communications data is that the plane made several turns, then flew south for five hours. That information led them to concentrate the search along a 400-mile arc from which the plane most likely sent its last signal.
The first phase of the search, lasting 52 days, was conducted from the air, covering 1.7 million square miles and involving 334 search flights.
Australia, China and Malaysia 
 that the search would end if the plane were not found. China is involved because 153 of the passengers on the plane were Chinese.
In December, investigators said they may have been 
 and recommended expanding the search zone. But the Australian government said that without more credible evidence on a specific location, the search, which cost a total of $150 million, would be called off this month.
“We remain hopeful that new information will come to light and that at some point in the future the aircraft will be located,” the statement on Tuesday said.
About 20 pieces of debris believed to be from the missing jet 
, including a wing part, known as a flaperon, that was found on Réunion Island, east of Madagascar, in July 2015. That location, combined with analysis of ocean currents, supported the theory that the plane had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean.

"HONG KONG — Chief Justice Zhou Qiang, 
’s top judicial official, is hardly a radical reformer. But to liberal-minded watchers of the country’s evolving court system, he has nonetheless been an encouraging figure.
In recent years, he has spearheaded an effort to make China’s judiciary, which is subordinate to the ruling Communist Party, more professional. He has pushed to weed out poorly trained judges and to raise the pay of those with formal legal training, which often includes 
.
So when the chief justice 
 to denounce the idea of an independent judiciary and other cherished liberal principles, warning judges not to fall into the “trap” of “Western” ideology, observers in China and abroad were shocked and dismayed.
“We should resolutely resist erroneous influence from the West: ‘constitutional democracy,’ ‘separation of powers’ and ‘independence of the judiciary,’” Chief Justice Zhou, the head of the Supreme People’s Court of China, said in a speech to legal officials in Beijing. “We must make clear our stand and dare to show the sword.”
The speech was widely seen as a bow to the strict political climate that President 
 has established in China, as a major Communist Party conclave approaches this year. Though Mr. Xi won plaudits this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for his support of 
, at home he has overseen a yearslong program to constrain civil society, promote adulation for Mao Zedong, stamp out support for an independent press and sharply limit speech on the internet.
“This statement is the most enormous ideological setback for decades of halting, uneven progress toward the creation of a professional, impartial judiciary,” Jerome A. Cohen, director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at New York University, wrote of the chief justice’s speech in a 
. “It has already provoked some of China’s most admirable legal scholars to speak out in defiance, and, despite their prominence, I fear not only for their academic freedom and careers but also for their personal safety.”
One Chinese scholar who spoke out was He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University, whose own online post criticizing the remarks was removed from the internet. In the post, he said it was wrong to call judicial independence a Western concept, citing the example of Bao Zheng, a famous Chinese judge who lived about 1,000 years ago and was celebrated for his just decisions.
“This is truly a statement that wrecks the nation and harms the people,” Mr. He wrote. “It truly goes against history.”
In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. He said Mr. Xi’s 
 at a Communist Party work conference two days before the chief justice’s speech had made it clear that he was demanding obedience from the judiciary.
“Xi said some very harsh things,” Mr. He said. “He demanded that political and legal work must safeguard the stability of the regime. So now heads of these judicial organizations must declare where they stand, to show that they support what Xi said.”
In his speech Saturday, Chief Justice Zhou also exhorted judges to “safeguard by law images of leaders and heroes, and to resolutely safeguard the party and the People’s Army’s glorious history.”
Mr. Cohen said that remark was consistent with Mr. Xi’s effort to whitewash the image of Mao, Communist China’s first leader. Since 2013, the Communist Party has spoken out against the notion of “historical nihilism,” which it takes to mean any denigration of the historical image of Mao and the party, including discussion of Mao’s disastrous economic policies in the late 1950s or his chaotic Cultural Revolution.
In recent weeks, the government has cracked down harshly on some officials who made negative remarks about Mao. In the northern province of Hebei, a deputy director of the Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television Bureau in the provincial capital 
 after making what were deemed “erroneous comments” on his social media account, which has since been deleted. Overseas Chinese reported that the comments were critical of Mao.
While his position is prestigious, Chief Justice Zhou is not a member of the Communist Party’s ruling Politburo. Before Mr. Xi’s ascension to power in 2012, the jurist was a 
, serving as the top official in Hunan, Mao’s home province. He was frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for a top leadership position.
Now he is showing his fealty to Mr. Xi, Mr. Cohen, the director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute, said in a telephone interview. He said the speech appeared to be a bid for political survival before the Communist Party Congress set for late this year, which will determine who serves directly under Mr. Xi for the next five years.
“People who know him find him a reasonable person who’s had a good legal education and who had been open before he became chief justice to improvements in the legal system,” Mr. Cohen said. “This must be pretty bitter gruel for him to swallow in order to try to bring the courts into a kind of militant observance of the highest party leadership.”","China’s Chief Justice Rejects an Independent Judiciary, and Reformers Wince","JAN. 18, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/china-chief-justice-courts-zhou-qiang.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MICHAEL FORSYTHE
"DAVOS, Switzerland — In a world troubled by grave uncertainties over the basics governing trade, security and the mission to limit 
, President 
 of China on Tuesday portrayed his nation as a responsible global citizen dedicated to furthering international integration.
That a leader of the People’s Republic of China can stake a claim to the mantle of leadership in the realm of free trade speaks to the unforeseen, even surreal alteration of the global order in recent months.
His message, delivered here in the Swiss Alps at the annual gathering of the 
, appeared meticulously timed to the tumultuous moment at hand. He was speaking three days before Donald J. Trump was to be inaugurated president of the United States, raising the prospect of a trade war with China, and on the same day that 
 to pursue her country’s departure from the European Union.
The Chinese leader used his moment to make an expansive case for globalization as a source of prosperity. He never mentioned Mr. Trump by name, nor did he even make reference to the fact that the White House is about to gain a new occupant. Yet his speech resonated as a rebuke of the trajectory that the president-elect has promised — not least, his 
 on Chinese goods as a response to what he portrays as predatory trade practices.
In myriad ways, Mr. Xi is a strikingly ill-fitting steward of openness and connectivity.
Under his direction, China’s Communist Party has clamped down severely on civil society, tightening restrictions on the internet and jailing scores of lawyers focused on using the country’s own laws to defend the rights of aggrieved people. He has projected China’s navy into contested waters in the South China and East China Seas.
Throughout his speech, Mr. Xi carefully used the phrase “economic globalization,” while avoiding unqualified “globalization,” reflecting China’s spurning of an open internet, universal human rights and free elections.
Indeed, the metaphor he used to reject protectionism — “like locking oneself in a dark room” — could just as well have been used to describe China’s political path under his leadership, with the Communist Party overtly guiding a campaign to restrict the influence of what it labels Western notions such as democracy. This month, China’s top judge delivered a speech sharply criticizing the idea of an independent judiciary, which he said must be “
.”
Not for nothing, China carries a reputation as a country willing to bend the norms of global commerce when such a course suits its interests. Steel producers around the globe complain that 
 on world markets at prices lower than the cost of raw materials, costing jobs at mills from Italy to Indiana.
But the populist ferment refashioning the global order has made previously unthinkable roles possible. In the United States, the supposed citadel of free market enterprise, a wealthy real estate magnate has captured the White House on the strength of his appeal as a supposed champion of blue-collar workers. Here in Davos, where technology executives fret about the plight of sub-Saharan Africa while drinking champagne paid for by investment banks, the chairman of the Communist Party of China — an institution that rules in the name of peasant-led revolution — draped himself in the banner of globalization.
None of these details were featured in Mr. Xi’s highly choreographed appearance at the gathering that has become a rite of passage into the ranks of the global elite.
For Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, the participation of China’s president amounted to a public relations coup because it was the first time a Chinese head of state had attended. Mr. Schwab obliged with his trademark soft treatment. He asked no questions, solicited none from the audience, and delivered an introductory address so laudatory that it provoked winces among some in the audience.
“In a world marked by great uncertainty and volatility, the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership in providing all of us with confidence and stability,” Mr. Schwab said.
That Mr. Xi chose this year to make his debut underscores China’s attempt to improve its international standing just as much of the world appears in turmoil.
The United States is about to inaugurate as president someone who has questioned the relevance of powerful institutions that have anchored the world order for decades, from NATO to the World Trade Organization. Britain is pursuing a fraught divorce from the European Union, dealing a blow to those who have advanced regional integration as a solution to economic and security problems.
The growing electoral strength of populist, anti-European Union parties in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany has intensified fears that the union may not endure.
These developments have yielded a gnawing sense that a complex world is suddenly short of adult supervision. Mr. Xi devoted his speech to trying to fill that vacuum, casting China as a trustworthy power in which serious-minded people are taking considered action to address consequential challenges — from climate change to a weak global economy.
“This appears to be a time of uncertainty in the United States, in the U.K.,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent venture capitalist in Beijing who invests in emerging Chinese companies. “The world needs strong leaders to give the world confidence.”
In keeping with the traditions of speeches delivered by senior Chinese officials, Mr. Xi’s address was long on platitudes, tortured metaphors and literary references, while nearly bereft of policy pronouncements.
Yet, in totality, it delivered a striking message: In an era in which the United States and Britain are consumed with recriminations over the strains of globalization, China will continue to tether its fortunes to world trade.
Mr. Trump has picked as 
 the economist Peter Navarro, who has long portrayed China as a mortal threat to American prosperity. Mr. Trump has threatened to brand the country a currency manipulator, opening the door to punitive tariffs.
Though Beijing has in years past maintained its currency, the renminbi, at artificially low levels to make its goods cheap on world markets, it has in recent months 
, propping up its value against the dollar.
“China has no intention to boost its trade competitiveness by devaluing the RMB,” Mr. Xi said.
In another implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump, the Chinese president argued forcefully for follow-through on the 2015 Paris climate accord. Mr. Trump has threatened to renounce the deal while naming to his cabinet several people who question the basic scientific consensus on climate change.
“The Paris agreement was hard won,“ Mr. Xi said. “All signatories should stick to it instead of walking away from it, as this is a responsibility we must assume for future generations.”
Mr. Xi was accompanied by an enormous delegation of Chinese officials and business executives who reveled in a moment on the world stage, posing for photos as they awaited the president’s arrival.
In conversations on the sidelines, many expressed concerns about the threats of tariffs from the incoming Trump administration, fearing the consequences of a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies. But most assumed tough rhetoric would eventually give way to the realities of shared commercial interests.
China relies on access to the United States, the largest consumer market on earth, as the landing place for its exports. The United States depends upon China for a vast range of finished goods.
Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said he assumed cooler heads would find a way to avoid trade hostilities.
“I don’t think it will happen,” he said of the hostilities. “It’s going to be a disaster if it does.”
More than a decade has passed since the United States Congress effectively prevented CNOOC, a Chinese state-owned oil company, from buying the American energy company Unocal, 
. Fu Chengyu, CNOOC’s chief executive at that time, pointed to the treatment of the merger as an indication of American hypocrisy on free trade.
But on Tuesday, as he waited for the Chinese president to deliver his address, Mr. Fu, who recently retired from another major Chinese energy company but retains a party post, expressed confidence that Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump would forge common ground.
“Eventually, they will cooperate to get more benefits,” Mr. Fu said. “At the beginning, Trump will say something very harsh. He will try to do something punishing. But this is a double-edged sword. Once he’s in the White House, he will see things differently.”","In Era of Trump, China’s President Champions Economic Globalization","JAN. 17, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/business/dealbook/world-economic-forum-davos-china-xi-globalization.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PETER S.

"BEIJING — Over the last year, Liu He, a soft-spoken, American-educated technocrat, has consolidated his status as President 
’s top economic adviser, amassing influence that some believe rivals that of the prime minister.
But as his star has climbed, Mr. Liu has struggled to overcome resistance to a program of measured economic liberalization and more open markets that he argues is critical to 
’s long-term economic health — and that is generally favored by Washington.
Now, as President-elect 
 prepares to enter the White House 
 of China’s economic menace, it will be even more difficult for Mr. Liu to achieve his agenda, which could be overwhelmed by fears of fallout from a trade war.
There is little in his public record to suggest precisely how he would advise Mr. Xi to handle Mr. Trump’s threats to raise tariffs on Chinese products.
But in a study he oversaw that was published as a book more than three years ago, he argued that China “cannot shoulder excessive responsibility” for reducing its trade deficits with other economies.
“Populist policies adopted by the governments of developed countries are often the instigators of crisis,” he wrote.
In the pre-Trump era, Mr. Liu was seen as the kind of Chinese official whom Americans could work with. He advocated China’s adjusting its saving and spending to help the United States recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
When President Obama’s treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, needed to cut through the fog of Chinese economic policy last winter, he 
.
“Liu He was always kind of a must-stop for Treasury because he had a macro view of the Chinese economy and the global economy,” said 
, the senior coordinator for China affairs at the Treasury in President Obama’s first term.
Mr. Liu was regarded as an insider with a direct line to the top.
Now he is widely expected to become the director of the National Development and Reform Commission, a powerful agency where he is currently a deputy director. That promotion would increase his visibility as well as his prospects of becoming a deputy prime minister in 2018, when a new government is formed for Mr. Xi’s second term.
Mr. Liu cannot dictate policy unilaterally, but his proximity to Mr. Xi gives him more sway than his bureaucratic-sounding titles would suggest.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that Liu He is extraordinarily powerful,” said 
, a senior China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “He has shifted from a stance earlier on when he was very careful not to demonstrate the level of influence he had.”
Beside pressing for a dose of economic liberalization and more room for markets, he has advocated trimming bloated state-owned industry and sought to curtail China’s ever-rising debt.
But even as he has gained influence, his ability to push through changes in these areas has been limited. Mr. Xi still calls the shots, and his pledge to revamp the economy jostles alongside his fiercely conservative agenda to restore party control and protect state companies. Mr. Xi’s promises of shaking up industry and reducing debt clash with vows to keep growth ticking.
Mr. Liu “is committed to reform, I have no doubt,” said 
, a Cornell University economist who used to be the China section chief at the International Monetary Fund. “Despite his commitment to the reforms, he doesn’t have the power to make it happen,” at least not without the backing of powerful allies.
The election of Mr. Trump and his selection of a trade team that seems ready to restrict China’s exports to the United States have only complicated the task ahead for Mr. Liu. The risk of layoffs in export industries, and even just the uncertainty about what lies ahead, will make it even harder to push through changes and may strengthen the hand of bureaucrats who want banks to keep lending heavily to keep businesses humming, regardless of losses.
Chinese trade experts with government ties have already hinted that if the Trump administration imposes barriers to Chinese goods, they are ready to retaliate through steps like switching aircraft contracts from Boeing to Airbus, diverting food import contracts to rival countries like Brazil and possibly making it more difficult for Apple to sell iPhones in China.
While Mr. Liu and other market-oriented economists may see an argument in principle for lowering some of China’s steep trade barriers, doing so amid the nationalistic backlash that could be provoked by American trade restrictions would be political poison.
But Mr. Liu is a savvy player. His response to his agenda’s being sidelined in 2015 offers an intriguing window into his political style and the art of waging policy battles at the top levels of the Xi administration.
A set of economic challenges that year — the stock market tumble in June, a currency devaluation two months later and a significant and unexpected slowing of economic growth — dampened the appetite for economic liberalization. Policy tensions opened up over the right balance between shoring up growth and imposing overhauls.
Mr. Liu began a canny lobbying effort aimed squarely at Mr. Xi.
In an apparent bid to win favor, Mr. Liu submitted a long memo in late 2015 praising Mr. Xi’s record in office and arguing that he had a historic mission to transform China, including by making bold economic changes, according to four people who have been told about the document by senior officials. All spoke on the condition of anonymity.
While the memo was not made public, Mr. Xi endorsed it by ordering it circulated among the party’s upper echelons.
Last May, an article by an anonymous official appeared in People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s main newspaper, warning of the risks of an overleveraged economy. The official, cited only as an “authoritative person,” accused laggard officials of undercutting reforms by trying to spend their way out of economic malaise, implicitly exempting Mr. Xi from any blame.
If rising debt is not restrained, “it will trigger a systemic financial crisis and lead to negative growth and even the evaporation of ordinary people’s savings,” the article said. “That would be fatal.”
Officials, economists and even reports in the Chinese news media have said the article came from Mr. Liu’s office, and the article echoes phrases and ideas Mr. Liu has used.
Still, the results of his campaign have been limited. Beijing disclosed on Thursday that bank loans and other credit rose again last month by more than Western economists had expected, a trend that has continued largely unabated in the eight months since the anonymous article appeared.
In nearly any room of senior Chinese officials, Mr. Liu stands out. While most other bureaucrats in their 50s and 60s dye their hair black, Mr. Liu, 64, has gray hair.
He also stands out for his American education, a rare qualification among senior Chinese officials. He received a master’s degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and before that he studied business at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.
Returning to Beijing, he rose quickly from writing studies of industrial policy as a government researcher to leading the party group that steers economic policy. In 2013, he became a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, which steers industrial policy.
“He was seen as influential under the previous presidency, and his influence has increased further under Xi Jinping,” 
, a former assistant Treasury secretary, said. “He had a well-informed, shrewd, balanced assessment of China’s structure and priorities. He didn’t come across as a firebrand.”
While his response to American trade restrictions is unknown, there is little doubt that a trade war with the United States would amplify the voices of economic nationalism.
As Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese newspaper controlled by the Communist Party, put it in an editorial this month: “There are flowers in front of the China Commerce Ministry gate, but sticks as well, hidden behind the door. Both are waiting for the Americans.”",U.S.-Trained Official May Shape China’s Response to Trump on Trade,"JAN. 18, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/liu-he-china-trade-trump.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY

The proposed amendments have been sent to party caucuses for negotiation and possibly further revision before a final version is approved outright or goes to a vote by the Legislative Yuan, a process that is expected to take months.
Still, the development was applauded by gay rights advocates, not just in Taiwan but in mainland 
 as well.
Among them was 
, a leading figure in the gay rights movement in Taiwan who now lives in Beijing. In 1999, Mr. Lai, who trained as an architect, opened 
 in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. It was billed as the first gay-themed bookstore in the Chinese-speaking world.
His mission was to create a space where sexual minorities could congregate openly and provide a platform to work for social change. In 2012, he moved to Beijing, where he and his business partner, Yeh Kenta, established what is now the 
. In an interview, Mr. Lai, 51, discussed the progress he had seen in gay rights, how Taipei differed from Beijing and how he dealt with the occasional visit by the Chinese police.
Very happy. It was just drafts that were passed, and they still need to undergo a process of consultation among political parties and more readings, and we don’t know what the final outcome will be. But most of my friends are delighted because, after years of campaigning for this, there’s finally some progress.
Final passage would be a milestone. Some of my friends in mainland China have told me they might go to Taiwan. Up to now, if they wanted to get married, they had to go to the United States or Europe. I feel that the gay community in China has been greatly encouraged. Since we share a similar cultural background, they believe that if Taiwan can achieve this they can start to expect more for China.
I’ve witnessed profound changes in Taiwan society since the lifting of martial law in the 1980s. I saw a lot of civic movements emerging and people taking to the streets to protest. I was quite young at the time and greatly inspired. I started to appreciate the significance of democratization.
Now, more and more people accept that, as a Taiwanese, it’s right to stand up for the underprivileged and the marginalized. Not just on same-sex marriage but on other issues, like environmental protection. Those who get involved are not always the ones directly affected, but they feel obligated to do something for those who are. That’s why, this time, we’ve also seen so many heterosexuals joining the demonstrations.
On Christmas Eve two years ago, we hosted a gay meet-up party at our cafe and invited about 20 people. In the middle of that, some police officers showed up and asked everyone to show their IDs. I was shocked, but our guests looked extremely calm. One after another, they took out their ID cards and showed them to the police. After the police finished checking them, they said fine and left. The party resumed, and our guests acted like nothing had happened. But I found it strange that they seemed so used to this kind of police intrusion.
Most of the people who come to our cafe are supportive. There are only a few who have objected. Once I saw a customer had commented on social media: “It turned out to be a gay bar. I won’t go there again.”
We’re not even a bar, let alone a gay bar. My colleague replied: “This is a cafe from Taiwan with a theme of cultural diversity. It’s not a gay bar, though we are in fact gay. Even if you don’t like this, please still show some respect.”
I have great admiration for any gay organizations that can survive in Beijing.
My cafe once hosted the 
. This is an international event that brings directors from all around the world. And when it comes to international events, there’s usually trouble. The police tend to interfere.
The Queer Film Festival has been held about a dozen times, and seven or eight times it’s been forced to shut down midway. Once they held it at 
, and when the police came, even a top university like that had to compromise.
So when we held it, we couldn’t openly publicize it. What we did was send emails to people in which we didn’t mention what was happening. We just told them to come watch a movie on which day and at what time. It turned out that a lot of people showed up, and the police didn’t.
Some people joke about this situation. They say that in Taipei it’s called a “gay movement,” but in Beijing it’s “gay activities.” You can have all kinds of activities, but you can’t allow any of them to turn into a movement.
Still, it’s not that hard to live in Beijing as a homosexual, if all you want is a quiet life and you avoid participating in any movements. I’ve seen many lesbian couples kissing each other in the subway. Gays can also host parties at home. But you can’t get involved in any protests or demonstrations. Basically, if you keep a low profile, the authorities don’t interfere.
I attended a wedding ceremony for a gay friend of mine. He’s the founder of 
, one of the biggest gay dating websites in China. He and his boyfriend sent us invitations for the event. But then he told guests that they should keep an eye out for a possible last-minute change of venue.
On the morning of the event, he telephoned that the site had changed. At noon he notified me that it was relocated again. That evening, they changed the site for the third time. Afterward, I learned that the police had called the first few places, which made them too scared to go through with it.
But finally there was a place near Ditan Park where they knew some people, and maybe because it was too late for the police to intervene, they succeeded in holding it. About 200 people attended. It was a very happy day.
It’s possible. But it’s hard to tell how long it might take. I’ve been living here for a while and can see the policy-making system in China is very different from what we have in Taiwan. Things can change very suddenly here. It might not take as long as in Taiwan.",On Taking Gay Rights From Taipei to Beijing: Don’t Call It a ‘Movement’,"JAN. 18, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/china-taiwan-same-sex-gay.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,YURU CHENG and
"LONDON — The Germans are angry. The Chinese are downright furious. Leaders of NATO are nervous, while their counterparts at the 
 are alarmed.
Just days before he is sworn into office, President-elect 
 has again focused his penchant for unpredictable disruption on the rest of the world. His remarks in a string of discursive and sometimes contradictory interviews have escalated tensions with 
 while also infuriating allies and institutions critical to America’s traditional leadership of the West.
No one knows where exactly he is headed — except that the one country he is not criticizing is 
 and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. For now. And that he is an enthusiastic cheerleader of Brexit and an unaffiliated 
. For now.
Mr. Trump’s unpredictability is perhaps his most predictable characteristic. The world is accustomed to his provocative Twitter messages, but is less clear about whether his remarks represent meaningful new policy guidelines, personal judgments or passing whims. In the interviews, Mr. Trump described the European Union as “basically a vehicle for 
” and predicted that the bloc would probably see other countries follow Britain’s example and vote to leave.
Mr. Trump also said Germany’s chancellor, 
, had made a “catastrophic mistake” in allowing refugees to pour into Europe.
The 
 in joint interviews published Sunday and Monday in Britain and Germany elicited alarm and outrage in Europe, even as Ms. Merkel dryly characterized Mr. Trump’s positions as nothing new.
“They have been known for a while — my positions are also known,” Ms. Merkel said Monday in Berlin. “I think we Europeans have control of our destiny.”
Her clipped response came as officials and analysts struggled with how to interpret Mr. Trump’s remarks, as well as how to react to them.
Some argued that the president-elect’s words should be regarded as tactical, intended merely to keep his options open. But nearly everyone agreed that Mr. Trump had made trouble, especially in criticizing Ms. Merkel, given her importance as a figure of stability in Europe and her campaign for re-election later this year.
For good measure, Mr. Trump had also infuriated China by using an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal to again question China’s longstanding One China policy. It holds that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the mainland.
On Monday, China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said that anyone trying to use the status of Taiwan for negotiations would be “smashing their feet by lifting a rock” and would face broad and strong opposition from the Chinese government and people, as well as the international community. She added that “not everything in the world can be bargained or traded off.”
The English-language China Daily accused Mr. Trump on Monday of “playing with fire,” saying that if Taiwan became up for negotiation, as Mr. Trump suggested to The Journal, “Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves.”
Mr. Trump’s interviews in Europe have placed him right in the middle of the Continent’s most contentious issues. His critique of German dominance over the European Union is hardly a novel thought; many Europeans share the same complaints. But what is startling is how an incoming American president would make such a statement about a key ally and, in doing so, give succor to populist parties seeking to shatter the European political establishment.
In the interview published Monday in the German newspaper Bild and The Times of London, Mr. Trump also equated his trust of Ms. Merkel with his trust for Mr. Putin.
“I start off trusting both,” he said during the joint interview, which was conducted inside his office in Trump Tower in New York, “but let’s see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.”
Certainly, Mr. Trump knows how to give a provocative interview. He repeated past criticisms that NATO is “obsolete” for supposedly not confronting terrorism, only to quickly add that “with that being said, NATO is very important to me.”
Mr. Trump’s comments “are a direct assault on the liberal order we’ve built since 1945 and a repudiation of the idea that the United States should lead the West,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official and ambassador to NATO, who also advised the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.
“To say that NATO is obsolete, openly support the disintegration of the E.U. and then denigrate Merkel and put her on a par with Putin is a fundamental break with 70 years of American policy and strategic thought supported by Republicans from Eisenhower to now,” said Mr. Burns, who has served presidents of both parties. “NATO is the great power differential between the United States and Russia, as our Asian alliances are the power differential between us and China.”
Mr. Trump’s remarks almost certainly rankled Europe’s two most powerful leaders, Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm for Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit — if welcomed by British officials, in general terms — has put considerably more pressure on Mrs. May. She is preparing to 
 about her Brexit plans, even as Mr. Trump promised to give Britain a quick and fair trade deal outside the European Union — a deal that cannot take place for at least two years until Britain leaves the bloc.
Awkwardly for her, one of the interviewers was Michael Gove, who strongly supported Brexit and ran for the Conservative leadership against Mrs. May, who immediately fired him from the cabinet. Mr. Trump’s first meeting with a British politician was with another May adversary, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP.
Ms. Merkel, who is known for her sang-froid and pragmatism, shrugged off Mr. Trump’s latest criticism, saying that what matters is what he does in office. “I am waiting for the president to be sworn into office. That is the way it is done,” she said. “And then, of course, I will work with him together.”
The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was not so sanguine. Mr. Trump’s comments had “caused astonishment and commotion, and I’m sure not just in Brussels,” where he spoke on Monday before a monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers.
Mr. Steinmeier said that he had just seen the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and that there was continuing concern inside the military alliance.
“First, it goes against the statements of the nominated defense secretary a few days ago,” Mr. Steinmeier said. “We have to see what it will yield in terms of U.S. foreign policy. The same goes for the statements on trade policy. We count on the U.S. to stick to its international obligations, including in the World Trade Organization.”
Others cautioned against taking Mr. Trump’s words literally, at least for now. “I take all of this with a pinch of salt,” said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the London-based research institution. “I think Trump is trying to keep his options open and not be cornered by simply standing up for existing policy positions.”
Mr. Trump’s transition team will try to begin to smooth over some of the tensions on Tuesday in Washington, where the group planning his inauguration will host a black-tie dinner for members of the foreign diplomatic corps to mingle with prospective cabinet members, leaders of Congress and Vice President-elect Mike Pence.
President Obama’s departing ambassador to Germany, John B. Emerson, has used a series of exit interviews and speeches in recent days to urge the Germans to stay calm, not to overinterpret Twitter posts or view them as finished foreign policy. Mr. Emerson underscored that, while more clarity was needed, there were signs that Mr. Trump did value NATO and the promise of United States protection for European allies.
“It’s a very crucial issue, not just for European security, but for American security,” Mr. Emerson said. He noted that Mr. Trump “authorized President Obama when he came here on his trip shortly after the two of them met to reassure European partners of the full commitment to NATO. Now, we need to see what that means.”
Yet 
, with elections coming in the Netherlands, France and Germany, and possibly in Italy. Victories by populist parties could destabilize the European Union, and many European officials worry that Mr. Trump’s attacks are damaging.
Martin Schäfer, a spokesman for Mr. Steinmeier and the German Foreign Ministry, flatly rejected Mr. Trump’s comment in the interview that the European Union “is basically a vehicle for Germany.”
“Perhaps in times such as these, when order is crumbling, it is more important than ever that we want to, and must, stand together,” Mr. Schäfer said, underlining the post-
 German stance that only through the country’s role in a larger European alliance are peace and prosperity guaranteed.
Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault of France said Mr. Trump’s comments were an invitation to the bloc to stand united. “As is the case with Brexit,” he said, “the best way of defending Europe, and that is the invitation Mr. Trump has given to us, is to remain united as a bloc, not forgetting that the strength of Europeans lies in their unity.”
The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who supported Brexit, emphasized Mr. Trump’s warm comments on the Anglo-American relationship. “I think it’s very good news that the U.S.A. wants to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast,” he said. “Clearly it will have to be a deal that’s very much in the interests of both sides, but I have no doubt it will be.”","As Trump Era Arrives, a Sense of Uncertainty Grips the World","JAN. 16, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/world/europe/trump-eu-nato-merkel-brexit-russia-germany-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,STEVEN ERLANGER
"When hope of enacting the ambitious 
 trade pact ended in November, 
, the United States ambassador to 
, was among the officials who had to grapple with disappointment.
The partnership, called the TPP, was a hallmark of the Obama administration. It would have been one of the largest trade agreements in history, covering about 40 percent of the world’s economy and setting new terms and standards for trade for the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. China was not included but would have been able to join.

Last week Mr. Baucus took the unusual step, with five other American ambassadors in the Asia-Pacific region, of sending an open letter to Congress asking its members to support the pact in an effort to cement a leadership position for the United States in regional trade and not 
, which has the second-biggest economy in the world.
In their letter, the ambassadors warn that “walking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role.”
“Such an outcome would be cause for celebration among those who favor ‘Asia for the Asians’ and state capitalism,” it added.

"There’s a new form of digital censorship sweeping the globe, and it could be the start of something devastating.
In the last few weeks, the Chinese government compelled 
 to 
 from the Chinese version of the App Store. Then the Russian government had 
, the professional social network, after the network declined to relocate its data on Russian citizens to servers in that country. Finally, last week, a Chinese regulator asked app stores operating in the country
, an apparent precursor to wider restrictions on app marketplaces.
These moves may sound incremental, and perhaps not immediately alarming. China has been restricting the web forever, and Russia is no bastion of free speech. So what’s so dangerous about blocking apps?
Here’s the thing: It’s a more effective form of censorship.
Blocking a website is like trying to stop lots of trucks from delivering a banned book; it requires an infrastructure of technical tools (things like 
), and enterprising users can often find a way around it. Banning an app from an app store, by contrast, is like shutting down the printing press before the book is ever published. If the app isn’t in a country’s app store, it effectively doesn’t exist. The censorship is nearly total and inescapable.
But that’s not the end of this story. The banning of apps highlights a deeper flaw in our modern communications architecture: It’s the centralization of information, stupid.
“I think the app store censorship issue is one layer of ice on the surface of the iceberg above the waterline,” said Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and a leader in the free software movement of activists who have long been warning about the dangers of centrally managed, commercial software.
For more than a decade, we users of digital devices have actively championed an online infrastructure that now looks uniquely vulnerable to the sanctions of despots and others who seek to control information. We flocked to smartphones, app stores, social networks and cloud storage. Publishers like The New York Times are investing in apps and content posted to social networks instead of the comparatively open World Wide Web. Some start-ups now rely exclusively on apps; Snapchat, for instance, exists only as a mobile app.
Compared with older forms of distributing software, apps downloaded from app stores are more convenient for users and often more secure from malware, and they can be more lucrative for creators. But like so much else online now, they risk feeding into mechanisms of central control. In most countries, the Apple and Google app stores are the only places to find apps for devices running their respective operating systems. (There are more choices for Android app stores in China, where Google does not offer its store.)
The internet’s earliest boosters considered it a magical tool to liberate people from restrictions on speech. The easy banning of apps suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite — one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.
This was not how it was supposed to be. Decentralized communications was once a central promise of the internet. In the 1960s and 1970s, with the world on the brink of nuclear Armageddon, a cadre of academic and military engineers set out to create a communications system that 
. The network they came up with, which evolved into the modern internet, connected every machine to every other through many different paths. That way, if any portion of the network were wiped out by an attack, traffic would simply route itself to a new path.
As the threat of nuclear attack diminished and the internet grew, its decentralized design became as much a political selling point as a technical one.
“Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere,” the activist John Perry Barlow argued in his 1996 manifesto, “
.” He predicted that because of the internet’s everywhere-ness, the world’s governments would never be able to lasso the digital realm. The computer scientist and activist John Gilmore 
, “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”
What the creators and early proselytizers of the internet did not foresee was the rapid commercialization of the network. The internet that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Gilmore envisioned was built and maintained by collectives of users; the one that users flocked to was tamed by companies whose very success turned them into some of the largest corporations on the planet.
The internet is now no longer “everywhere and nowhere.” Just about all of its economic value is instead connected to two very specific somewheres: the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, the homes of Apple, 
, Google and 
, the four monstrously large companies that own the internet’s central information platforms. As these companies began to build ever-larger empires online, they have evolved into convenient choke points — the very points of control that the internet was designed to eliminate.
Like all companies, online companies must offer some level of deference to governments. They obey local and national laws, court orders and national security authorities, and bend to other, less transparent means of coercion. They can fight governments — as Apple did when it 
 over unlocking a terrorist’s iPhone last year — but they often must pick their battles and balance their interests. Apple makes a significant fraction of its profits from China. Can it really risk all those billions to protect a handful of apps?
Apple offered this statement in response to my queries on how it decides to take down apps: “For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China, and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.” Google declined to comment.
But Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights activist organization, said the internet giants were not without leverage in this fight.
“The flip side of that is, is China going to block the entire Apple App Store over a single app?” she asked. Interestingly, the internet giants’ hold on every aspect of online life works toward their advantage in battling governments.
“The bigger a company is, the bigger the risk that blocking them will lead to riots in the streets because you have come between people and their pictures of cats,” Ms. Galperin said. “Those are the companies that governments are going to be more wary of blocking, and they should be the ones that stand up to government pressure. They have a special responsibility.”
Users and app developers who are now at risk of being censored also bear some responsibility. When I asked Mr. Moglen at Columbia about app bans, he was incensed that I didn’t recognize The New York Times’s own complicity in this story.
The Times, he argued, could have stuck with the old way of publishing news. The company could have declined to create a downloadable app and instead invested all of its engineering resources into making its news available on the web, anonymously. The Times could have refused to profile users for advertising purposes, or to have its articles hosted on Facebook, or to monitor what people read in order to recommend more articles to keep people engaged. In short, The Times could have refused to play the modern digital-publishing game. But like every other publisher, it went along.
“What did you expect would happen?” Mr. Moglen asked. “China didn’t have to build a Great Firewall to do this. You all offered them an opportunity to piggyback onto your disrespect for the privacy and integrity and autonomy of your readers and users.”
I don’t agree with Mr. Moglen that The Times disrespects its readers by offering a news app. (I think it’s a very nice app.) But he is right that a lot of people online walked blindly into the no-win position we are in now, where our only recourse against censorship might be the good will of a few giant corporations that control most of the internet.
There has to be some other way.

" is canceling plans to build more than 100 coal-fired power plants, seeking to rein in runaway, wasteful investment in the sector while moving the country away from one of the dirtiest forms of electricity generation, the government 
 in a directive made public this week.
The announcement, made by China’s National Energy Administration, cancels 103 projects that were planned or under construction, eliminating 120 gigawatts of future coal-fired capacity. That includes dozens of projects in 13 provinces, mostly in China’s coal-rich north and west, on which construction had already begun. Those projects alone would have had a combined output of 54 gigawatts, more than the 
, according to figures compiled by Greenpeace.
The cancellations make it likelier that China will meet its goal of limiting its total coal-fired power generation capacity to 1,100 gigawatts by 2020. That huge figure, 
 the total coal-fired capacity in the United States, is far more than China needs. Its coal plants now run at about half of capacity, and new sources of power, like wind, solar and nuclear, are coming online at a fast clip.
Nevertheless, China’s capacity would have surged well past the 1,100-gigawatt mark by 2020 had it not begun canceling coal-fired plants in the works. The new announcements are in addition to cancellations 
.
“The key thing is that yes, China has a long way to go, but in the past few years China has come a very long way,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a researcher for Greenpeace in Beijing.
Electricity generated from coal is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that lead to 
, and pollution from such plants contributes to the 
 that has blanketed much of China this winter. But despite the vast amount of capacity added in recent years, China’s coal use has been on the decline since 2013.
Still, China’s state-owned power companies remain politically powerful. Grid operators often 
 over that made by wind and solar, and despite the cuts, China is still building far more capacity than it needs.
In contrast, utilities in the United States have only four coal-fired plants set to go online through 2020, with a combined capacity of 
, according to the Energy Information Administration. The United States retired more than 13 gigawatts of coal capacity in 2015 as the country shifted toward natural gas, wind and solar.
Despite the government announcement, it is far from clear that the Chinese jurisdictions most affected by the directive, including Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Xinjiang, will actually take the politically costly move of halting construction, laying off workers and canceling contracts, said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University in southeastern China.
“Some projects might have been ongoing for 10 years, and now there’s an order to stop them,” he said by telephone. “It’s difficult to persuade the local governments to give up on them.”
But Mr. Lin and Mr. Myllyvirta said one factor that made the directive likelier to succeed was its specificity. It names each project set for cancellation, putting provincial and other local officials on the spot and making it harder to continue the projects.","China Cancels 103 Coal Plants, Mindful of Smog and Wasted Capacity","JAN. 18, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/asia/china-coal-power-plants-pollution.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MICHAEL FORSYTHE
"BEIJING — When Zhang Xiaomo worked on a farm in Manchuria in the early 1970s, she shuddered at the screeching noise of trucks pulling over on the icy roads. Her mind would dart back to the summer of 1966, when gangs of men would arrive most nights in large trucks, banging on the door and ransacking the courtyard house she lived in by herself. It was the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, and her mother, hunted for her contact with the Japanese during 
, had gone into hiding.
“They kept coming day after day,” she recalled in her Beijing apartment recently. “They were a bunch of grown-up men, and I was 13 years old, all by myself. I felt like I couldn’t take it anymore.” The experience still haunts her.
Half a century has passed since Mao Zedong plunged 
 into the “10 years of chaos,” as the Cultural Revolution is often called here, wrecking the Communist Party apparatus and upending the lives of ordinary people like Ms. Zhang. Mao’s obsession with ridding the country of enemies brought public humiliation, political exile and starvation upon countless individuals. Perhaps more than a million lost their lives.
But the party, whose legitimacy and image remain inextricably tied to Mao, has refused to fully reckon with his historical sins. And with public discussion of the Cultural Revolution’s legacy still largely forbidden, it remains difficult to gauge one of the most serious consequences of the tumultuous period: its impact on the Chinese soul.
“The essence of the Cultural Revolution is not just that Mao unleashed it and caused the chaos,” the Harvard China historian Roderick MacFarquhar 
. It “is that the Chinese, without direct orders, were so cruel to each other.”
Born in 1988, more than a decade after the end of the Cultural Revolution, I grew up hearing my relatives’ occasional reminiscences of daily life in the era: the food coupons, the Mao badges, the exchange of greetings with quotations from the ubiquitous “Little Red Book.” In one of my earliest recollections, my grandmother showed me a pile of old sweaters, explaining with a proud smile that she knitted them as a distraction from the “
” taking place on the stage in her work unit’s auditorium in the late 1960s.
Yet the emotional scar has never faded away. In late 2015, when a singer stepped onto a neon-lit stage in Shanghai to 
 about the tribulations of his family of six during the Cultural Revolution, the outpouring of public emotion surprised many people. One web commenter, quoting a line from the song, reflected: “ ‘After the Cultural Revolution, there were five of us left.’ That is not just the story of his family, but that of many others.”
The psychic damage of the Cultural Revolution has been the subject of only a few small-scale studies. An 
 project carried out by Chinese researchers in collaboration with German psychotherapists in the early 2000s showed that people with Cultural Revolution-related trauma exhibited symptoms typical of post-traumatic stress disorder: Many reported intense anxiety, depression and frequent flashbacks of traumatic experiences; some showed emotional numbness and avoidance behaviors.
Cultural Revolution trauma differs from that related to other horrific events, like the Holocaust and the 
, 
 have noted, in part because in China, people were persecuted not for “unalterable” characteristics such as ethnicity and race, but for having the wrong frame of mind. Constant scrutiny of one’s own thinking and actions for signs of political deviance became a necessity for survival that sometimes carried unbearable weight.
Recalling her high school years in the early 1970s, my mother describes a nagging fear of “letting an ‘unrevolutionary’ word slip in public.” It did not dissipate until more than a decade after Mao’s death in 1976.
Such vigilance offered no guarantee against becoming a victim. A 2007 
 of 108 Cultural Revolution participants showed that neither joining the Red Guards nor believing in Maoism protected someone from suffering long-term trauma.
Fickle political winds turned attackers into targets overnight, causing people to label one another class enemies less out of ideological conviction than out of revenge or pressure to toe the right line. The blurry distinction between perpetrators and victims makes collective healing by confronting the past a thorny project.
Wu Di, a co-founder of Remembrance, a journal of history and culture, invited members of opposing factions on a university campus during the period, now in their twilight years, to share their accounts. But his attempt at bringing reconciliation brought back unsettled scores. Each side, rejecting the story of the other, claimed victimhood from the events.
“They’ve never sat down and talked about it,” Mr. Wu told me last year. “They still can’t.”
More personal reasons may also shape people’s response to mental trauma.
Mental illness remains deeply stigmatized in China. Private despair was incompatible with the collectivist spirit and the bright Communist facade under Mao. Many traumatized people, as a result, would describe their emotional pain as physical ailments.
Xu Xiaodi, a retired teacher who saw her relatives beaten to death during the Cultural Revolution, is more forthright than most about the mental toll. She said she had experienced bouts of bad temper and powerful mood swings in its aftermath. She averts her eyes from elderly women performing boisterous dances on public squares — a popular pastime here — because they prompt her memories of struggle sessions staged by Red Guards.
But people “tell me just to move on,” she said to me. “They say, because the whole generation suffered in those years, even the national leaders.”
Rejecting such arguments, many people like Ms. Xu have refused to let go of the past by choosing to bear its psychic impact. But a growing body of research suggests that the past can have a way of 
 of those who directly experienced it through the transgenerational transmission of trauma. The idea that life experiences could cause inheritable genetic changes has been identified among 
 who have been shown to have an increased likelihood of stress-related illnesses.
The possibility of epigenetic inheritance has been 
 by Chinese academics regarding the Cultural Revolution, but to research the topic would most certainly invite state punishment.
Ms. Zhang, who spoke of the midnight house raids, mentioned another event that weighed on her. During the “rustication movement” in late 1960s, when millions of youths left the cities to work in rural areas under Mao’s command, she reported to her teacher that a classmate had hidden her age to evade the order. The classmate, Ms. Zhang said to me, had once insulted her family at a struggle session. She was promptly sent to northwestern China, where she labored for years.
After the Cultural Revolution ended, Ms. Zhang looked for her, and found her working as an usher in a small movie theater in her hometown. Ms. Zhang admitted to the classmate what she had done and apologized. “She was stunned for a while.” Now they both live in Beijing, Ms. Zhang told me. “We see each other every now and then.”",A Scar on the Chinese Soul,"JAN. 18, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/a-scar-on-the-chinese-soul.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,HELEN GAO
"I continue to be astonished that not enough Americans are sufficiently alarmed and abashed by the dangerous idiocies that continue to usher forth from the mouth of the man who will on Friday be inaugurated as president of the United States.
Toss ideology out of the window. This is about democracy and fascism, war and peace, life and death. I wish that I could write those words with the callous commercialism with which some will no doubt read them, as overheated rhetoric simply designed to stir agitation, provoke controversy and garner clicks. But alas, they are not. These words are the sincere dispatches of an observer, writer and citizen who continues to see worrisome signs of a slide toward the exceedingly unimaginable by a man who is utterly unprepared.
In a series of interviews and testimonies Donald Trump and his cronies have granted in the last several days, they have demonstrated repeatedly how destabilizing, unpredictable and indeed unhinged the incoming administration may be. Their comments underscore the degree to which this administration may not simply alter our democracy beyond recognition, but also potentially push us into armed conflict.
Last week, 
 during his confirmation hearing that the United States had to “send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.”
The only way to do this is with some sort of naval blockade, which China would undoubtedly interpret as an act of war.
Indeed, 
Chinese state-run media responded in an editorial, “Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.”
Business Insider quoted Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who pointed out that Tillerson’s position could easily result in war.
If the United States put “a cordon of ships around one or all of the islands, and the Chinese flew in aircraft to one of their new islands, what are we going to do? Shoot it down?” Glaser asked. “We’d certainly end up in a shooting war with China.”
But even short of the conflict over the islands, 
 suggested Tuesday, Trump’s talk on trade alone could escalate into an armed conflict with China. Trump has said he will make continued adherence to the “one China” policy — which recognizes Beijing as the sole government of China — conditional on negotiations over what he sees as currency manipulation and other unfair trade practices by China.
As Browne points out:
“The gambit has profound security and military implications. Taiwan is a regional flash point. Beijing regards the island as an inalienable part of Chinese territory; ‘One China’ expresses not just its political desire for unification but a core part of Chinese identity. Chinese leaders will fight for it. They can’t lose Taiwan.”
Make no mistake: As bad of an actor as China is, the United States actually depends on China. It is one of our biggest trade partners, but furthermore it is one of the last remaining checks on an erratic North Korea. China could simply stop using its influence to make North Korea behave.
And as you may recall, during the campaign Trump suggested that the way to contain North Korea was for 
. In March, Trump said of nuclear weapons: “You have so many countries already — China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia — you have so many countries right now that have them.” He continued: “Now, wouldn’t you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?”
Then there is the destabilizing and downright frightening random rhetoric. Trump has suggested that he 
 America’s friend-in-arms Angela Merkel and his friend-in-spirit Vladimir Putin.
Trump told 
 this week that he may start having military parades in major American cities à la North Korea: “Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country.” He continued: “And we’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military. That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military.”
And, Trump continues to 
, calling it “obsolete.”
This is insanity. But too many Americans don’t want to see this threat for what it is. International affairs and the very real threat of escalating militarization and possibly even military conflict seems much harder to grasp than the latest inflammatory tweet.
Maybe people think this possibility is unthinkable. Maybe people are just hoping and praying that cooler heads will prevail. Maybe they think that Trump’s advisers will smarten him up and talk him down.
But where is your precedent for that? When has this man been cautious or considerate? This man with loose lips and tweeting thumbs may very well push us into another war, and not with a country like Afghanistan, but with a nuclear-armed country with something to prove.

"Different governments have different ways of controlling what information their citizens do or do not see. In recent years, technology — used to do things like blocking websites or choking off social media feeds — has become crucial to those governments’ efforts.
Now, some countries are increasingly exercising a form of digital censorship over another tech arena, app stores, by determining what apps should or should not be sold in the stores,

"International human rights groups are calling on 
 to drop charges against a Tibetan entrepreneur and education advocate who was indicted by court officials this month for “inciting separatism.”
The Tibetan advocate, Tashi Wangchuk, was detained nearly one year ago after speaking to The New York Times for a documentary video and two articles on 
 and 
.
 and 
 have both issued statements in recent days asking for China to release Mr. Tashi, 31.
A lawyer for Mr. Tashi, Lin Qilei, said judges in the Yushu Intermediate Court, in western China, would probably not schedule the trial until after the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which runs from Jan. 27 to Feb. 2.
Mr. Tashi said he was not guilty of the separatism charge, Mr. Lin said. In interviews in 2015 with The Times, Mr. Tashi said he did not support independence for 
.
Another lawyer for Mr. Tashi, Liang Xiaojun, has said the Yushu police focused their investigation of Mr. Tashi on the 
 produced by Jonah M. Kessel, which showed Mr. Tashi’s attempts to file a lawsuit against local officials to compel them to expand Tibetan language education. Mr. Tashi had also written about the language issue on his blog.
Defendants who go on trial in China are almost always convicted. In political cases like that of Mr. Tashi, orders are sent from senior officials to the court. If convicted, Mr. Tashi could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.
Mr. Tashi’s legal case has taken some unusual turns. The groups issuing statements are hoping that Mr. Tashi’s case will not go to trial and say international pressure could be critical now.
Amnesty International said in a statement Wednesday that it was 
 to ask specific officials in China to free Mr. Tashi. It listed contact information for prosecutors and the police in Yushu, Mr. Tashi’s hometown, and Qinghai Province, as well as the governor of Qinghai.
Amnesty said Mr. Tashi was a “prisoner of conscience, detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.”
Human Rights Watch released a detailed chronology of the case and 
“Tashi Wangchuk has joined the ranks of those prosecuted in China by simply calling for rights to be respected and the law to be upheld,” said Sophie Richardson, the group’s China director. “Cultural rights, which include the right to use one’s own language, are protected under both the Chinese Constitution and international human rights law.”
Mr. Tashi’s case has drawn intense international attention. In December, Max Baucus, the United States ambassador to China, mentioned Mr. Tashi and several other political prisoners in China in a 
. PEN America, a group that promotes freedom of expression, noted Mr. Tashi’s detention in a 
 in September that criticized China’s attempts to censor foreign reporting.
A campaigns director with Students for a Free Tibet, based in New York, said Wednesday that the group planned to ask its members to publicly advocate for Mr. Tashi.
Lawyers for Mr. Tashi were allowed to visit him briefly last year in a Qinghai detention center. Mr. Lin said Mr. Tashi was in good spirits, given the circumstances, and was writing up points to make in his defense during a trial. When interviewed by The Times in 2015, Mr. Tashi insisted repeatedly that his remarks be on the record and said he knew he could be imprisoned after publication of the video and articles, given the political sensibilities in China over Tibet.
Mr. Tashi traveled to Beijing in 2015 to look for lawyers to help him file his lawsuit and to try to get China Central Television, the state network, and foreign journalists to document his efforts and the lack of robust Tibetan-language education in public schools in Tibetan regions.
Mr. Tashi said he wanted to use Chinese laws to expand language education, and he praised President Xi Jinping for having “promoted a democratic and law-abiding country these last few years.”
Mr. Tashi was 
 on Jan. 27, 2016, two months after publication of the video and the first article. Prosecutors sent the case to the court in September to have the court indict Mr. Tashi and schedule a trial, but then 
, a move that was “very rare,” Mr. Lin said. Prosecutors resubmitted the case in early January.
Tibetans living under Chinese rule often say they are concerned about the dwindling use of their language, especially among younger Tibetans. Tibetan teachers and students in Qinghai Province have held protests over language education in recent years.
Mr. Tashi ran a shop in central Yushu from which he sold local goods in person and online. Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company, chose Mr. Tashi to be 
 for the company’s investor roadshow before a high-profile initial public offering.

"With a new administration taking office this week, it is natural to assess the inheritance it will receive from the old.
There are some who see nightmares wherever they look and insist that the entire global system is unraveling and that America’s position as world leader is in precipitous decline.
As the departing secretary of state, I cannot claim objectivity. But I will leave office convinced that most global trends remain in our favor and that America’s leadership and engagement are as essential and effective today as ever.
A major reason is that 
 has restored assertive diplomacy as our foreign policy tool of first resort and deployed it time and again to advance our security and prosperity.
This is evident, first of all, in our campaign to defeat the Islamic State, also known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh. Two and a half years ago, these murderers were on the march across Iraq and Syria. Instead of rushing into a unilateral war, we responded by quietly helping Iraq form a new and more inclusive government, and then assembling a 68-member coalition to support a rehabilitated Iraqi military, the Kurdish Peshmerga and other local partners to liberate territory once occupied by Daesh.
We are engaged in a climactic effort to free the largest remaining strongholds in Iraq (Mosul) and Syria (Raqqa). These military steps depended on the diplomatic cooperation we brokered to cut off Daesh’s finances, slow its recruiting and rebut its poisonous propaganda on social media and within the region.
President Obama took office with 
’s 
 racing ahead and our nation under mounting pressure to take military action. While making clear we would do whatever it took to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, we started with diplomacy, building the strongest international sanctions regime the world has ever seen, and testing whether Iran would negotiate a deal that could ensure its nuclear program was exclusively peaceful. As a result, without firing a shot or putting troops in harm’s way, the United States and our partners reached the 
, which blocked Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon and made our nation, our allies and the world safer.
When 
 invaded Ukraine in 2014, the United States could have responded as we had six years earlier, when Russian intervention in Georgia was largely met with rhetoric alone. But having repaired diplomatic ties badly damaged by the Iraq war, the Obama administration was able to defy skeptics by working with our 
 partners to impose sanctions that have isolated Russia and badly damaged its economy. We also bolstered 
 with a major expansion of our security assistance to allies in the Baltics and Central Europe.
Throughout, we continued to work with Russia when it was in our interest to do so. But because we have stood firm, Russia is now — despite the boasts of its leaders — plagued by dwindling financial reserves, a historically weak ruble and poor international relations.
President Obama has made clear to our allies and potential adversaries in Asia that the United States will remain a major force for stability and prosperity in their region. We have rallied the world behind unprecedented sanctions against a menacing North Korea, increased our naval presence in the Pacific, worked with regional actors to support the rule of law in the South China Sea and forged a strategic partnership with India. We also united key partners behind a landmark, high-standard trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that we still believe should be ratified by Congress — all while maintaining an often mutually beneficial relationship with Beijing.
When President Obama took office, efforts to protect our planet from the catastrophic impacts of 
 were going nowhere, stymied by decades of division between developed and developing countries. But our outreach to 
 led to a series of breakthroughs that made last year the most consequential in the history of climate diplomacy. Building on, rather than backing away from, that progress would allow a historic shift toward clean energy and a chance of saving the planet from the worst ravages of climate change.
The fruits of this administration’s diplomacy can also been seen in our own hemisphere, where we strengthened our position by normalizing relations with Cuba and helped end Colombia’s decades-long civil war. In Africa, we gained friends by training young leaders and led a successful global effort to contain 
.
Obviously, we haven’t solved every problem, particularly in the chronically combustible Middle East. But the United States was absolutely justified in stressing the need for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.
I also remain convinced that the formula we pursued to end the agonizing conflict in Syria was, and remains, the only one with a realistic chance to end the war — using diplomacy to align key countries behind establishing a nationwide cease-fire, providing humanitarian access, marginalizing terrorists and promoting Syrian-led talks on creating a constitution and democratic government.
The response of the international community to the tragedy in Syria will long be debated. For years, United States officials had those same debates in the Situation Room. Some options, such as an enormous deployment of ground troops, were rightly dismissed. Others, including deploying additional special forces in limited operations, were closer calls. Month after month, we weighed the deteriorating conditions and uncertain benefits of intervention against the very real risks, including deeper involvement in a widening war. While I did not win every argument — no policy maker does — I can testify that all viable ideas received a fair hearing.
I am not a pacifist. But I learned as a young man who fought in Vietnam that before resorting to war, those in positions of responsibility should do everything in their power to achieve their objectives by other means.
I just returned from Vietnam, where smart and sustained diplomacy has accomplished what a decade of war never could: developing a dynamic capitalist society, opening an American-style university with the promise of academic freedom and, perhaps most improbably, strengthening ties not just between our people, but also between militaries that once saw each other as enemies.
Looking ahead, my hope is that the turbulence still evident in the world does not obscure the extraordinary gains that diplomacy has made on President Obama’s watch or lead to the abandonment of approaches that have served our nation well.
Diplomacy requires creativity, patience and commitment to a steady grind, often away from the spotlight. Results are rarely immediate or reducible to 140-character bites. But it has helped build a world our ancestors would envy — a world in which children in most places are more likely than ever before to be born healthy, to receive an education and to live free from extreme poverty.
The new administration will face many challenges, like every administration before it. But it will take office this week armed with enormous advantages in addressing them. America’s economy and military are the strongest in the world, and diplomacy has helped put the wind at our back, our adversaries on notice about our resolve and our friends by our side.",John Kerry: What We Got Right,"JAN. 19, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/opinion/john-kerry-what-we-got-right.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JOHN KERRY

“I really can’t take it anymore,” she said. “He’s been gone for so long, and we’ve had no news. We don’t know where he is. His lawyers haven’t seen him. We don’t know if he’s alive or dead.”
So on Tuesday, Ms. Jin, who had already appealed to United States officials for help, turned to someone else she hoped could raise her husband’s case with the Chinese authorities: the German chancellor, 
, whom Mr. Jiang met at the German Embassy in Beijing. Ms. Jin has a photograph of the meeting, which she says probably took place in either 2014 or 2015.
The German Embassy declined to comment on Thursday, but Ms. Merkel and 
 visiting China have met with dissidents, often at the embassy.
“Merkel pays attention to China’s human rights situation,” Ms. Jin said. “So my hope is that she will pay attention to Jiang Tianyong’s situation and ask, ‘Where is he locked up?’ Can German diplomats meet him and tell us if he’s dead or alive? If he has been tortured? Has he been given his blood pressure medication? Have they been giving him other drugs, strange things?”
On Tuesday, Ms. Jin sent a letter to Ms. Merkel through 
, requesting help not just for her husband but for other rights lawyers and activists detained since the government 
 beginning in July 2015, detaining about 250 people. Most have since been released or charged, some with subversion or incitement to subversion.
In her letter to Ms. Merkel, Ms. Jin wrote, “The experience of the past year has been torture for us family members too: endless smearing by the official media, repeated reports of our loved ones suffering torture, incrimination of family members and defense attorneys, countless illegal procedures.”
Here are her requests:
While it is unclear whether Ms. Merkel will respond, the Chinese government is unlikely to welcome Ms. Jin’s raising the profile of her husband’s case. However, it may come under greater pressure to respond to the accusations of rights abuses and torture.
Ms. Merkel, who grew up in the former East Germany, is often perceived by China’s embattled rights activists as having a close understanding of Communist-run states and of supporting rights advocates, when possible.
Ms. Jin said on Thursday that she had not received a reply from Ms. Merkel but that she did get confirmation that her appeal had been received.
In response to a request for comment, a German government spokesman in Berlin said by email late Thursday that Ms. Merkel had regularly met with civil society representatives on her visits to China but that the government does not release their names. Nor does it make public the names of individuals whose cases are brought up with the Chinese authorities, said the spokesman, who asked that his name not be used in keeping with protocol.
Qin Chenshou, one of Mr. Jiang’s two lawyers, said they shared Ms. Jin’s concern that their client was being tortured.
“We continue to demand to see him,” Mr. Qin said in a telephone call.
On Tuesday, Mr. Qin applied to the state procuratorate in Changsha, Hunan Province, where Mr. Jiang had disappeared, asking it to ensure that Mr. Jiang was being treated humanely. In China, the procuratorate has supervisory powers over the police.",Wife of Detained Chinese Rights Lawyer Seeks Angela Merkel’s Help,"JAN. 19, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/world/asia/china-lawyer-jiang-tianyong-germany.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW
"TOKYO — She is the colorful face of 
’s largest hotel chain, known for her garish fashion sense and business books with titles like “I Am a President.”
He is the darker side of the partnership: a right-wing polemicist who has leveraged the couple’s success to support contentious political causes, including defending Japan’s militarist past.
Now Fumiko Motoya and her husband, Toshio, founders of APA Group, a Japanese real-estate and hotel empire, are facing a barrage of criticism in 
. Their twin projects — business and conservative politics — collided this week in an uproar over right-wing historical books promoted at APA’s chain of 370 budget hotels, in which such publications are often distributed to rooms in much the same way as Gideon Bibles in American hotels.
The furor over the books, which promote the claim that Japanese forces did not massacre Chinese civilians during a rampage in Nanjing in 1937, has prompted a rebuke from Beijing and threats of a boycott by Chinese travelers, a fast-growing and economically important group for Japan.
“This once again shows that some forces in Japan are still reluctant to look squarely at history, and even try to deny and distort history,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said on Tuesday, as the outcry took on international political dimensions. On Thursday, China’s Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall said it strongly protested the books.
The number of foreigners visiting Japan reached a record 24 million last year, fueled in large part by a surge of visitors from China looking for good food, clean air and quality shopping. Despite continued tensions with its neighbor, Japan has embraced the tourist rush in its effort to look for economic growth drivers, with many retailers hiring Chinese-speaking sales clerks. Last year, Japan approved plans 
, with Chinese gamblers partially in mind.
The Motoyas have shown how fraught that embrace can be. APA’s stance has touched off anger online in China and condemnation from official media outlets, along with calls for Chinese travelers to take their business elsewhere.
APA has been unrepentant. In a statement, it said that “historic interpretation and education vary among nations,” but it defended Mr. Motoya’s claims about Nanjing.
“Therefore, we have no intention to withdraw this book from our guest rooms,” the company said, adding that “no one-sided pressures” would force it to change its mind. APA invited readers to correct any inaccurate statements “so that we can seriously study about them.”
The Motoyas may not be as well known as another divisive and politically minded hotelier, Donald J. Trump, nor are their midmarket properties as gilded. But in Japan, they come close to being stars. Ms. Motoya, in particular, has embedded herself in popular culture though books, television appearances and an intermittent singing career.
Wearing the fanciful hats that are her trademark, Ms. Motoya appears in advertisements for APA’s hotels and “APA president” merchandise like curry and rice crackers. She judges televised karaoke contests sponsored by the company, and a CD of her 
 can be purchased on APA’s website.
The Motoyas are among the most prominent backers in Japan of rightist historical revisionism. While Fumiko Motoya represents the APA brand in public, her husband writes essays and books that seek to put Japan’s sometimes brutal imperial past in a kinder light. Their activism has put them at the center of controversies that have bedeviled Japan’s relations with China and South Korea for decades.
“As political patrons, they can’t be ignored,” said Tamotsu Sugano, an author who has researched Japanese rightist groups. “They spread money everywhere.”
The Motoyas have used a fortune estimated to be in the billions of dollars to court and support politicians, mostly on the conservative end of the spectrum — from the center-right establishment to the fringe. Guests at their long-running wine parties have included Shinzo Abe, the current prime minister, according to a record of an event in 2005 that includes a photograph and was circulated by APA at the time.
A Japanese magazine, Shukan Gendai, has estimated that Mr. Motoya, who serves as president of the overall APA Group while Fumiko leads the hotel division, is Japan’s fourth-richest person, with assets worth 220 billion yen, or about $1.9 billion. Shukan Gendai made its calculation based on tax records and on published APA documents, but because the company is privately owned, its disclosures are scarce and a precise figure is difficult to obtain.
The Motoyas hail from Fukui, a rural area on the Sea of Japan, where they met while working at a small local credit union, according to Ms. Motoya’s autobiography. They built APA from a small operation beginning in the 1970s, starting with real-estate sales before moving into hotels for budget-conscious business travelers. In 2015, they expanded to the United States by buying a 200-room former Hilton hotel in Woodbridge, N.J.
Right-wing literature has long been a staple, if odd, amenity at APA hotels in Japan. Much of it is written by Mr. Motoya, who uses a pen name but acknowledges authorship.
The books and articles describe a kind of alternative historical universe, one where Japan fought entirely nobly in 
 and in which its alleged atrocities were invented by Chinese and Korean propagandists. The accounts differ sharply from those of mainstream historians, both in Japan and abroad.
One piece of literature that was featured for years was an essay by a former air force general, Toshio Tamogami, which won a prize in an APA-sponsored contest in 2008. In it, Mr. Tamogami claimed that Japan had been duped into attacking the United States at Pearl Harbor in 1941, in a plot he said was hatched by Communists inside the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Mr. Tamogami was fired for writing the essay, and subsequently campaigned unsuccessfully to become governor of Tokyo and for a seat in the national Parliament, before being 
 last year.
The latest controversy was touched off by a video on the internet. Posted by a couple describing themselves as an American woman and a Chinese man who stayed at an APA hotel, it shows excerpts from a book by Mr. Motoya denying the Nanjing massacre and the forcible recruitment of women into wartime Japanese military brothels. The video spread quickly through the Chinese internet this week, generating outrage and promises of a boycott.
For its part, the Japanese government appears to want to keep its distance. The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, declined to comment on the APA books when asked on Wednesday, saying only that Japan, China and South Korea should seek “forward-looking” ways to cooperate.",Right-Wing Hoteliers in Japan Anger China With Radical Historical Views,"JAN. 19, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/japan-china-motoya-hotel-apa.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JONATHAN SOBLE
"BEIJING — China’s economy firmly hit its growth target last year and even accelerated a bit at the end. In most countries, that would be seen as unequivocally good news.
But this is China, where figures are sometimes doubted and where economists look for signs of strain underneath the numbers. Indeed, Chinese officials who released the economic data on Friday faced questions about the country’s mounting debt. And in an unusual move, its central bank on Friday took an extra step to inject more money into the economy over the next month.
China’s economy grew 6.7 percent last year after accelerating slightly to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the government’s statistics bureau announced on Friday morning.
The strong economic growth in 2016 came after a weak start last year, when China’s currency and stock market were tumbling and many foreign investors fretted that the country’s three decades of robust economic expansion might be ending.
The Chinese government appears to have delayed an economic reckoning, but at a high cost. The central bank and state-owned banks shoveled trillions of renminbi into a surge of credit, putting aside longstanding worries about a deeply indebted corporate sector and signs of a real estate bubble. The government borrowed and spent heavily, continuing oversize projects like the construction of world-class highways and 
 lines to cities that are increasingly remote from the main hubs of economic activity near the coast.
But Ning Jizhe, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, dismissed concerns about rising debt.
“I don’t think this worry is necessary,” he said at a news conference.
Hours after the data release, the central bank said on its official Weibo microblog account that it was providing temporary help to “several large commercial banks” that have been distributing large sums of cash ahead of China’s Lunar New Year celebrations, which begin at the end of next week.
Chinese and foreign economists generally agree that the best hope for the country’s long-term economic health is for the current emphasis on debt and investment to give way to greater consumer spending. Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending climbed 9.6 percent last year, led by blistering growth in online retail sales of 26.2 percent. But as in other countries, 
, much of that growth has come at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores and malls.
When Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China’s central bank, 
 last February that the answer to China’s immediate economic troubles lay in more mortgages, few paid close attention. Chinese officials previously expressed concern that real estate prices were already too high, hurting affordability and exposing the economy to significant risks if prices tumbled.
But after Mr. Zhou’s remarks, state-owned banks were instructed to step up mortgage lending, and the results were spectacular. Sales of commercial buildings rose 34.8 percent, and residential sales climbed 36 percent as prices leapt higher and higher. The steel, cement and glass industries — all suffering from overcapacity in recent years — benefited as they supplied builders, and electricity production to power those factories rose. Municipal governments in Shanghai and elsewhere began imposing administrative controls this winter to limit further real estate price increases.
More mortgages were part of a big expansion in the overall credit moving through the Chinese economy. To achieve its 6.7 percent growth last year, the Chinese government allowed total credit to rise at nearly two and half times that pace, according to a calculation by Louis Kuijs, an economist at Oxford Economics. Credit used to grow at the same pace as the economy, but debt has been accumulating faster than the economy’s output since the global financial crisis.
The central bank, the People’s Bank of China, said on Friday afternoon that it was providing liquidity assistance for 28 days to several large commercial banks. It did not identify the banks. The central bank also did not provide details except to say that it was using a market mechanism to make sure the extra money entered the country’s financial system.
The People’s Bank of China did not respond to requests for clarification. Stock markets were up on Friday in China, and short-term interest rates were only slightly higher — two signs that while money may be fairly tight in China ahead of the holidays, any difficulty has not yet become severe enough to alarm investors.
Many concerns have been raised about the quality of Chinese economic data. Western economists have suggested that Chinese government statisticians underestimate growth in boom years and overestimate growth during busts to present a smoother overall picture of the Chinese economy. Worries about data quality increased after the state-run People’s Daily quoted Chen Qiufa, the governor of the northeastern province of Liaoning, as saying on Tuesday that local governments had inflated growth data from 2011 to 2014.
But many economists say last year’s growth appears to have been real — although bringing additional debt that could burden the economy for years to come. Mr. Ning insisted on Friday morning that national economic data was reliable, and he added that if local officials were caught fabricating data, “we will show no leniency.”","China’s Economy Grows Strongly, Yet Central Bank Eases Policy","JAN. 19, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/china-gdp-economic-growth.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,KEITH BRADSHER
"HONG KONG — Xiaomi, the smartphone start-up that showed the potential and the limits of a new generation of Chinese technology companies, is losing its most familiar global face.
On Monday, Hugo Barra, a Google veteran who ran Xiaomi’s global division, said he planned to resign and return to Silicon Valley. Mr. Barra became the global face of Xiaomi, a little-known phone maker as it became 
 and a 
.
But his departure comes as some of that promise looks to be in doubt. Xiaomi grew quickly in China by selling cheaper smartphones with premium features, initially only online. It has had mixed success outside China, however. At home, it faces rising competition from big, deep-pocketed rivals like Huawei Technologies and other scrappy upstarts like the Chinese brand OnePlus.
Two years ago, Xiaomi was valued 
. Today, the company, which is privately held, is widely considered to be worth far less.
In a note about his resignation on Facebook, Mr. Barra, who joined Xiaomi in 2013, called his time there “spectacular” and said that he was moving on for personal reasons.
“But what I’ve realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health,” he wrote, adding that he was moving back to Silicon Valley to be closer to friends and family.
Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, said that Mr. Barra’s departure was a blow to the company and that it called into question the future of Xiaomi’s fledgling overseas business.
“The question is, Who will replace him? Will that person be as effective an ambassador?” he said. “They’re doing fine in India, but what happens for everything else? Where does this all sit in the grand plan they had several years ago to expand to a bunch of markets?”
Xiang Wang, a veteran of Qualcomm who has led Xiaomi’s supply chain and intellectual property rights teams, will take over Mr. Barra’s responsibilities and lead Xiaomi’s global business, Xiaomi said. Mr. Barra did not respond to a request for comment.
Xiaomi has long been targeted by critics who accuse it of 
. Yet its earlier success presaged the rise of other Chinese start-ups, such as the drone maker DJI, and demonstrated the power of the country’s fast-growing e-commerce sector.
Mr. Barra, the vice president responsible for Xiaomi’s global division, presided over international expansion. Unlike China’s other major internet companies, Xiaomi made an early decision to expand beyond China’s borders, targeting markets like India, Myanmar and Brazil.
Mr. Barra, a widely recognized name in the tech world, was often the public face of that expansion. Orchestrating product releases in new markets and acting as an ambassador, he often gave talks in local markets to build buzz.
Xiaomi has done relatively well in India, which accounted for about 18 percent of the company’s total phone shipments in the third quarter of 2016, according to IDC.
In other markets it has been less successful. For instance, after a high-profile release of its phones in Mr. Barra’s home country of Brazil in 2015, the company has not been able to establish a significant beachhead there.
Competition has intensified in China from Huawei, OnePlus, Lenovo Group Limited and other companies getting into the handset business. From the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016, Xiaomi’s market share in China dropped to 8 percent from 16 percent, according to IDC.","Xiaomi, Chinese Phone Maker, Losing Its Global Face as Hugo Barra Exits","JAN. 23, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/business/xiaomi-hugo-barra-resigns-smartphone.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PAUL MOZUR
"The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is over, assigned, for now, to the same corner of history as the hunt for Amelia Earhart: a cold case. An unsolved mystery.
The nearly three-year-long effort to find the missing jet cost $160 million, the largest and most expensive search in aviation history. For the investigators who scoured 46,000 square miles the Indian Ocean seabed, there will be no answers. For the families of the 239 victims, there will be no closure.
“It is incomprehensible that they would give up right now,” said Grace Nathan, 28, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the flight. “I can’t imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air,” Ms. Nathan said after learning that the search had been stopped.
For all the technical questions asked during the search — Why did the plane go down? And where? — ending it raises a host of ethical questions: Do countries have an obligation to keep looking? How much should they spend? Is the search for a missing plane any different from the search for missing individuals?
Flight 370 
 from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Investigators determined that the plane had veered off course and flown south for several hours, for reasons unknown.
On Tuesday, the governments of 
, 
 and 
, which together have conducted the search for the missing plane, said experts last year concluded that the plane had crashed within a vast area of the Indian Ocean north of the search zone but that further efforts to find it would be prohibitively expensive. The governments said they would re-open the investigation only if credible evidence came to light of the location of the plane, a Boeing 777.
Their announcement has pitted victims’ relatives against the leaders of their countries, who said continuing the search was not worth the expense.
“The underwater search for MH370 has been suspended. The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness,” the countries said in a joint statement released on Tuesday.
Investigators are obligated to continue the search, family members said, to bring emotional closure, to provide the only concrete evidence to explain what felled the plane and to prevent similar accidents.
“It extends beyond me and my family,” said Ms. Nathan, a member of Voice370, a group that represents relatives and friends of those aboard. “Of course we would like to know what happened. But millions of people fly every day on Boeing aircraft, and the flying public has the right to know what happened,” she said.
Experts said little new information would be learned even if the plane were discovered, although the mystery still vexes them.
The Boeing 777 “enjoys a phenomenal safety record,” said Capt. John M. Cox, a former airline pilot and the chief executive of 
, an aviation consultancy based in Washington. “We now have an open question about the safety of one airplane. That is a major issue and one that will remain open, and no one wants that.”
Captain Cox argued that investigators should have completed the search of an additional 10,000-square-mile area that experts identified in December as the possible crash zone, but that ultimately they would have to conclude the search at some point, however disappointing. “We’re not enhancing safety, just by searching,” he said.
Another aviation expert made a similar technical argument for ending the search now.
“No matter what,” said the expert, Prof. R. John Hansman Jr., director of the International Center for Air Transportation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “it’s going to remain a mystery. You’re not going to get closure.”
Professor Hansman said the existing evidence suggested that mechanical failure did not lead to the crash but that the pilot was most likely responsible. Even if investigators were to find the wreckage and recover the cockpit voice recorder, it would prove useless, he said.
The plane, he said, remained aloft for five hours on a consistent trajectory until its fuel was exhausted. But the recorder includes only five hours of tape, and “what we would have gotten is five hours of silence.” The data recorder, he said, would also be useless because “the plane flew for hours without a systemic problem.”
Beyond the technical arguments for ending the search are the philosophical ones.
Given that no living passengers can still be found, said Peter Singer, an ethics professor at Princeton University, resources should be reallocated to help the most people.
“One hundred and fifty million dollars was already far too much to spend on the search for the missing plane, so calling off the search now is the right decision,” Professor Singer said.
“It is estimated that by donating to the Against Malaria Foundation so that it can distribute more bed nets, it is possible to save a life for approximately $3,000,” he said. “If that is accurate, then the money spent on the search could have saved 50,000 lives. Would anyone think that finding the plane is more important than that?”
But the math to end the search has to be driven by more than just money, said Msgr. Anthony Randazzo, an auxiliary bishop in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney, Australia.
“This is not a callous dismissal of the fact that we can’t find them, and there is no intention to disregard the individuals so we can make our administration or our paperwork more streamlined. It is a recognition of the limitations of our ability to be able to locate people,” he said.
“That is a very important thing,” Monsignor Randazzo said. “I have not heard that this search has been halted because nobody cares anymore. In fact, it is the complete opposite. It is an admission of our limitations.”",239 People Are Dead.

"BEIJING — It seemed that China’s censors had finally muzzled Yang Jisheng, the famed chronicler of the Mao era. Last year, he had finished writing a widely anticipated history of the Cultural Revolution. But officials warned him against publishing it and 
 from traveling to the United States, he 
, and he stayed muted through the 50th anniversary of the start of that bloody upheaval.
Now Mr. Yang has broken that silence with the publication of his history of the 
, “The World Turned Upside Down,” a sequel to “
,” his landmark study of the famine spawned by Mao’s policies in the late 1950s. The 1,151-page book is the latest shot fired in China’s war over remembering, or forgetting, the dark side of its Communist past, a struggle that has widened under the hard-line president, 
.
“I wrote this book to expose lies and restore the truth,” Mr. Yang writes in the book, which has been quietly 
, beyond the direct reach of Chinese censors. “This is an area that is extremely complicated and risky, but as soon as I entered it, I was filled with passion.”
Since Mr. Xi took power in 2012, the Communist Party authorities have denounced historians who question the party’s lionization of its past and exhume grim events like the Cultural Revolution, which Mao started in 1966, opening a decade of purges and bloodshed.
Tens of millions were persecuted and perhaps a million or more people were killed 
. But officials say dwelling on such events is subversive “historical nihilism” aimed at corroding the party’s authority.
In a sign of how Chinese politics has chilled, Mr. Yang has said little publicly about the book.
“Since the book was published, I’ve been told not to discuss it with foreign media,” he said in a brief telephone conversation. He would not say whether he had authorized “The World Turned Upside Down” to be published in Hong Kong.
“There’s quite a lot of pressure,” Mr. Yang said. “I just wanted to restore this big story and the facts behind it, to recover the history.”
Mr. Yang, 76, was a university student in Beijing when the Cultural Revolution erupted. He threw himself into the early phase, when Mao unleashed student radicals to purge school leaders and Communist Party cadres.
Mr. Yang later worked as a journalist for Xinhua, the state news agency, watching as the fervor of the Cultural Revolution fractured into disarray and disillusionment. After a career in journalism, he turned to writing histories of contemporary China.
Up until several years ago, Chinese newspapers and magazines still published 
 of Mr. Yang. But now he is often 
 by Maoists emboldened by the hard-line pronouncements.
Party journals have 
 that up to 36 million people died in a famine from 1958 caused by the Great Leap Forward, Mao’s reckless attempt to leap into a communist utopia, which Mr. Yang chronicled in “Tombstone.” That book was published in Chinese in Hong Kong in 2008.
“Yang Jisheng is not a historian,” 
 in Global Times, an ardently pro-party Chinese newspaper, said last year. “He leaves the impression that he’s not interested in history, and virtually all his later works display strong political tendencies.”
Last year, Yanhuang Chunqiu, a liberal-leaning Chinese history magazine where Mr. Yang was long a chief editor, was 
 by editors much more willing to toe the party line. The changed atmosphere was also evident when a court in Beijing 
 to apologize for questioning the party’s heroic account of a 1941 battle in the war against Japan.
Last year, too, Chinese media mostly stayed silent about the 50th anniversary of the start of the Cultural Revolution. An exception was 
 in the party’s main newspaper, People’s Daily, which urged citizens to look to the future.
“Chinese political culture, both past and present, insists that the legitimacy of rulers depends on an immaculate record of what they have done,” said 
, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has written widely about Chinese culture and politics.
“They’re afraid that telling the truth about those events pulls the rug on their right to rule,” he said. “They want to be damn well sure that history stays inside its box.”
Now that “The World Turned Upside Down” has appeared in stores, the next battle will be over whether people get to read it in China, where such books are banned.
The book began appearing in late December in Hong Kong, which keeps its own system of law, including much greater freedom than is found in mainland China. That freedom has shrunk in recent years. Publishers there have 
 by the 2015 abduction to China of five Hong Kong booksellers who peddled lurid, poorly sourced potboilers about China’s leaders.
Even so, Hong Kong remains an enclave for books banned in mainland China. Piles of Mr. Yang’s book in bookstores there suggest that mainland readers have been buying copies to sneak across the border, despite customs checks.
“Mr. Yang’s work is quite influential inside China,” said Jian Guo, who together with Stacy Mosher translated “Tombstone” into English and is translating “The World Turned Upside Down” with Ms. Mosher.
“Yes, some of his books, including ‘Tombstone,’ are banned on the mainland,” Mr. Guo said. “But an electronic version of ‘Tombstone’ has been floating around since 2008, and an enormous amount of pirated copies has been distributed by small book vendors.”
Mr. Guo, a 
 at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, said the abridged translation of Mr. Yang’s latest book would include about two-thirds of its original content.
“We expect to publish in 2019,” Eric Chinski, the editor in chief of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, said in an email. The company also published an abridged translation of “
” in 2012.
Mr. Yang’s book is by no means the first history of the Cultural Revolution; several were published under official auspices in mainland China in earlier decades as the Chinese government tried to confront the ordeal of the era.
But in recent years, the party has become much more wary about allowing such research. Many younger people have only a sketchy idea of what happened when Mao started the Cultural Revolution to purge China of what he saw as threats to the purity and survival of his revolution.
Mr. Yang “wanted his readers to remember the tragedy of the past, whether it was the Great Famine or the Cultural Revolution, to reflect on it, to make sense of it, so that the tragedy would not repeat itself,” said Mr. Guo, the translator.
“He considered this task of a conscientious rememberer to be all the more urgent now in the face of the officially enforced historical amnesia in China,” Mr. Guo added.
Mr. Yang did not have extensive access to archives for his new book, as he did when he wrote “Tombstone.” Instead, he drew on hundreds of memoirs, histories and studies, many published in Hong Kong or available online, and there are fewer revelations than in his previous book.
As in other recent scholarship, Mr. Yang emphasizes that much of the worst bloodshed came later in the Cultural Revolution, when Mao brought back the military and party apparatus to brutally enforce order.
“It’s fair to say this is a work by an eminent journalist, rather than a product by an academic historian,” said 
, a historian of the Chinese Communist Party at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He said he had read some draft chapters of Mr. Yang’s book, and found a few debatable claims.
But Mr. Yang “was working under very difficult conditions, and thus deserved great respect for his moral courage,” Mr. Sun said.",Historian’s Latest Book on Mao Turns Acclaim in China to Censure,"JAN. 21, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/world/asia/china-historian-yang-jisheng-book-mao.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"The first thing you notice in the stairwell to the fourth-floor studio on Canal Street in Manhattan is the measured thumping coming from behind a metal door.
Just beyond the entrance, large papier-mâché lion masks were twisting and turning to the drumbeat. On a recent Friday evening, the teenagers made their way across the studio floor — sagging from decades of jumps and lunges — as they practiced Chinese lion dancing.
“You want to play in a circle,” Victor Fong, 24, told his students at the New York Chinese Freemasons Athletic Club. “Take it slow and do it again.”
The dance troupe, made up of 60 members, performs throughout the year but was now preparing for its biggest events, 
, which will begin on Saturday and conclude on Feb. 15. Teenagers comprise about half of the group, many of whom began lion dancing at 14.
About 100 current and past members of the troupe — which has been performing since 1956 — will be among the 220 groups marching through Chinatown in Manhattan for the 18th Lunar New Year Parade on Feb. 5.
Mr. Fong has been involved in the organization since he was 15 and began teaching lion dancing three years ago. But the club also acts as a recreation center and safe haven for teenagers, with video games readily available. As many as 20 students show up after school.
“The basic requirement for hanging out here is you have to learn how to lion dance,” Mr. Fong said. While that is not a formal requirement for being a member, everyone finds a way to participate in the Lunar New Year Parade, whether it’s by dancing, carrying a flag or beating a drum.
Alvin Chau, 26, is an environmental consultant by day and a lion dancer on weekends. He has been a club member for 10 years and joined because of an interest in lion dance.
“Everyone is a big family,” he said, shaking hands with other members as they walked through the door. “You know everyone.”
It is believed that the lion dance began in the third century.
Stories vary about how lion dancing came to be, but most of them include a monster named Nian who would terrorize a village. The villagers finally banded together and scared the beast away with firecrackers and drums. While lions are not native to China, some versions of the story include the villagers 
 of their own in the shape of a lion to fight off the beast.
Today, the dancers travel across Chinatown going from business to business to bring good luck for the coming year.
The new year — 4714 according to the Chinese lunar calendar — will begin on Saturday and marks the Year of the Rooster, which is thought to be a symbol of positivity.
“It’s almost like the dark night is ending and the sun is coming up,” said Ya Yung Teng, the digital collections coordinator for the 
. “It’s hopeful that we’re going to have a new day.”
Roosters and chickens are not particularly strong creatures, Ms. Teng said, but they are numerous.
“In a way,” she said, the rooster “stands for ‘We the People.’”
The lion head and adjoining tail are operated by two people, and their dance is weighted heavily in martial arts. As one person masters the head, a second follows under a train of fabric representing the body. The dancers move in unison as they mimic the animal’s approach to a carcass, the slyness of the walk and the aggressiveness of an attack.
A lion head figure weighs under 10 pounds and sits squarely on the dancer’s shoulders. Inside, the dancer manipulates strings that wink the head’s eyelids, shake its ears and open its mouth to reveal a fire-orange tongue.
“A good lion dancer will simulate a living creature,” said Karlin Chan, 59, who heads the athletic club’s community outreach.
“I started lion dancing when I was a kid,” he said. “Chinatown was much smaller then and it was a celebration with fireworks and firecrackers, which added a lot of flavor and meaning to it.”
The dance itself has also evolved.
“In the old days it was a way to show your martial-arts school’s proficiency and how good you were,” Mr. Chan said. “Now it’s evolved into more of a dance.”
Mr. Chan buys a new lion head each year when he travels to China. A head costs about $1,500.
“If you want the good stuff, the quality, you have to see it for yourself,” Mr. Chan said. “I’ll inspect the product before we put it in the crate and send it over.”
Mr. Chan, who has been involved with the club for nearly 50 years, said that passing the dance from one generation to the next was vital.
“You need to pass on the traditions and the culture, and this is a part of our culture,” he said. “It’s a great way to promote cultural understanding and cultural exchange; we welcome that.”
For Sara Pore, 17, another club member, lion dance is more than just tradition; it provides a creative outlet.
“Lion dancing started 2,000 years ago — that’s incredible,” she said. “But what makes you a competent lion dancer is that there is a sense of imagination involved. Lion dancing teaches competence in leadership because of this. You’re constantly forced to push yourself past your limit.”
Back at rehearsal, Justin Le, 18, tied a red sash around his waist to practice jumping. The dancers use the sashes to pull themselves up over their partners’ heads. The room’s ceilings are too low to wear the lion heads for jumping practice, so once up on his partner’s head, Mr. Le held out his arms as if in offering.
Mr. Le comes by the dance as a legacy.
“I was born into it,” Mr. Le said, noting that his uncle and father were club members. “Growing up, I would always watch my family and see the lion dance, and I slowly grew interested in it.”
By 14, he was fully enrolled in the athletic club’s lion dance troupe.
“I value my culture and tradition, being Chinese or Asian-American. I have a lot of pride in that,” he said. “I want to contribute and give back to the community.”",A Club Where Lions Dance and Traditions Take Root,"JAN. 22, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/nyregion/a-club-where-lions-dance-and-traditions-take-root.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,REMY TUMIN
"BEIJING — Perched unsteadily on a stack of plastic stools in an isolated room, 
, a Chinese lawyer, was encircled day and night by interrogators who blew smoke in his face, punched and kicked him, and threatened to turn him into an “invalid” unless he confessed to political crimes, he has said.
Eventually, according to transcripts of meetings with Mr. Xie issued by his attorneys, the isolation, sleepless days and nights of abuse and threats to his family from the police investigators proved too harrowing. Mr. Xie said he had scribbled down whatever they told him to say about trying to subvert the Chinese Communist Party by representing disgruntled citizens and discussing rights cases.
“I wanted to end their interrogation of me as quickly as I could, even if it meant death,” Mr. Xie, anguished and often sobbing, told his attorneys, Chen Jiangang and Liu Zhengqing, according to the 
 this month that Mr. Chen released on Thursday. “Later, I wrote down whatever they wanted.”
The records lay out the most detailed firsthand allegations thus far that torture has stained a crackdown on Chinese rights lawyers and advocates that began in July 2015. The government detained almost 250 people in that operation, according to 
. Most were released, but four were tried and 
 on charges that they tried to subvert the one-party state, and 
 are in detention and likely to face trial.
Mr. Xie, 44, a lawyer from the southern Chinese province of Hunan, is also likely to face trial in the coming weeks on subversion charges, according to his lawyers.
“These transcripts are totally authentic,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview on Friday, referring to two detailed records of pretrial meetings with Mr. Xie that were released on 
 focused on human rights in 
. “He’s suffered torment and abuse, and this was a call for help, because the internal mechanisms for preventing torture haven’t worked.”
Other defendants and suspects in the clampdown on rights lawyers have abjectly declared their guilt, either in court or in televised confessions. Mr. Chen said that Mr. Xie wanted to release his account of his secretive detention to prove beforehand that he was innocent and that any admissions had been made under coercion.
“He was unbending. He refused all government lawyers. In the end, they had to let us see him,” Mr. Chen said, since he and Mr. Liu had been chosen by Mr. Xie. “We all know this kind of case is about political persecution.”
Mr. Xie’s wife, Chen Guiqiu, had also approved releasing the transcripts, Mr. Chen said. But Ms. Chen, an academic, did not answer repeated calls to her phone on Friday. Mr. Chen, the lawyer, said she had been led away that morning by security guards at the university in Changsha, the capital of Hunan, where she works.
“Let the world know what forced confession through torture is, what shamelessness without limit is,” Ms. Chen said in 
 issued on Thursday.
Mr. Xie’s account of being locked away appeared after China’s president, Xi Jinping, sought this week to promote his government as open and mature. On Tuesday, 
 the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that economic protectionism was like a country locking itself in a dark room.
Li Chunfu, a Beijing lawyer detained in the crackdown, was released early this month, emaciated and mentally shattered after nearly one and a half years in detention, according to his 
.
“It’s ironic that the Chinese government is calling for openness in Davos when the Chinese government is doing the opposite domestically,” 
, a researcher on China for Human Rights Watch, said by telephone from Hong Kong. “They say one thing in terms of rhetoric, to appeal and charm globally, but what they do is quite another thing. What they do is exactly the opposite.”
Human rights organizations and defense lawyers have said that other suspects caught in the crackdown have also been at risk of torture while in secretive detention. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied such accusations. The police in Changsha did not respond to multiple phone calls to find out whether they knew of Mr. Xie’s allegations of torture and were doing anything about them.
But Mr. Xie has gone to extraordinary lengths to back his claims: He named many of the officers he says perpetrated abuses. “If I stand trial, I’ll recount to the court just what happened in this case — that the records were the product of torture,” he told his lawyers.
Mr. Xie was taken away by the police in Hunan on July 11, 2015, and spent half a year in secretive detention in a retired military cadres’ hostel, kept from contact with the outside world. In the first week, Mr. Xie said, he was questioned by rotating teams of officers who gave him no more than three hours of sleep between grueling rounds of questioning.
Often they made Mr. Xie sit on top of the “dangling chair”: several plastic stools without backrests that were stacked on top of each other.
“I sat on top so that my feet didn’t touch the ground and my legs were dangling there. They ordered me to sit there with my back straight,” he said. He said that an officer warned him: “If you move, we can consider that you attacked a police officer, and we can take whatever steps to deal with you.”
In addition, the interrogators would not let him drink water, lit fistfuls of cigarettes and blew nauseating clouds of smoke in his face, and beat, kicked and head-butted him, he said. They also indirectly threatened his wife, warning that she should be careful when driving, he said.
“We represent the party center in handling your case,” one police officer said, referring to China’s central leadership, according to Mr. Xie’s account. “Even if we leave you dead, you won’t find any evidence to prove it.”
By mid-August 2015, Mr. Xie said, he was broken, and he signed documents put before him, but still he resisted the interrogators’ demands that he name and implicate other people. A year ago, he was 
 on a charge of inciting subversion of state power and was moved to a detention center. But there, the abuses continued, and other detainees were used to bully him, Mr. Xie said.
Despite pressure from the police and prosecutors, Mr. Xie insisted on seeing his own lawyers. On Friday, 
 prosecutors to examine his claims of torture, listing the names of 10 police officers they say should answer the accusations.
“I tell you now that my spirit is free,” Mr. Xie told his lawyers. “I declare that I, Xie Yang, am innocent.”","Punches, Kicks and the ‘Dangling Chair’: Detainee Tells of Torture in China","JAN. 20, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/world/asia/china-lawyer-torture-xie-yang.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"DATANG, China — For six generations, Chan Kuai-hung’s family has worked and lived on the rivers of southern 
, roving on wooden boats that served as fishing vessels and homes. But Mr. Chan said his generation would be the last to take up this floating life.
“They don’t fish anymore,” said Mr. Chan, a 55-year-old with craggy, stone-hard hands from a lifetime of rowing and hauling fishing nets. “No one in the family is taking up this tradition.”
He was among a dozen men and women living on the river in Datang, a town in Guangdong Province, who had gathered to light firecrackers to celebrate a recent marriage. About 200 boats from their community floated offshore, and on the riverbank families sorted catches of fish and clams. But the newlyweds, like most young people from here, had no plans to join that life on the water, Mr. Chan said.
“Our culture is on the verge of extinction because young people under 30 head into the city for work,” said a woman who had overheard our conversation. She was shy about talking to outsiders, like many residents here, and gave only her surname, Lam.
“Look at our hands; you can see that we do hard manual labor,” Ms. Lam said, extending her calloused fingers. “Our life depends on the weather and the waters.”
The residents of this floating village are members of the Tanka group, an ancient people scattered across southern China who have survived on coastal waterways, and on the margins of society. But Guangdong is a caldron of manufacturing and urban growth. Cities have engulfed once-quiet towns, and the Tanka way of life is disappearing.
A cement plant on the shore opposite the village in Datang discharged fumes into the air. Apartment blocks have risen along the riverfront. The briny, tidal water of the Bei River, the residents’ lifeblood, has been dredged and is polluted, overfished and crowded with ships.
“Many Tanka people who have settled onshore haven’t told their children about their Tanka background,” said 
, a professor at Guangzhou University who studies the Tanka people. “The Tanka life on the water is disappearing, and it’s also disappearing as a culture.”
Yet Tanka people rarely voiced regret for the passing of their old ways. Their dislocated lives left little room for nostalgia or even for remembering their folk songs, called saltwater songs. Fishing and living on boats, many said, were a means of survival, not cultural preservation.
“We have no choice but to hang on to our old way of life, because it’s the only skill we know,” Mr. Chan said. “I don’t want our tradition to be preserved if the younger generation doesn’t want to keep it.”
Drivers speeding over the expressway bridge across the river in Datang can glimpse a seemingly random crowd of fishing boats and larger houseboats for families of four or more.
But the Tanka community here forms a tight web that spans the river and the shore. The riverbank is a jumble of fishing nets, poultry coops and shanties. Chickens and ducks, which families raise for extra food, strut along the shore. Each family seems to own one or two dogs.
Some residents were mending their handsomely simple wooden boats ahead of the busiest fishing season. They honed planks of hardwood into panels, and used glue and plaster to fill cracks on the 12-foot-long hulls. The fishermen now use outboard motors to move up and down the rivers here or out into bays, but their boats looked like relics from a previous century.
“I didn’t really learn from anyone; I just picked it up along the way,” said one of four men repairing a boat. He gave only his surname, Lam. Like most of their fishing boats it had holes drilled into the front of the hull, creating a space where fish could be stored alive and sold for a higher price at the market. But he had not even tried to pass on fishing skills to his two sons.
“My dad said there’s no future in fishing,” said Chan Kin-chor, a 25-year-old electrician who had dropped by to help his father-in-law fix a boat. “When you walked through here, how many people born after 1990 did you see?”
On the water, families slept, cooked and watched television on houseboats, some big enough for a family of four or more. Small stoves onboard dull the winter cold. Often the owners are older people caring for grandchildren whose parents are away, working in factories or stores.
“We pull the firewood from the water,” said Leung Kwai-mui, 56, who was minding her grandchildren on a houseboat. “If we go up into the hills to collect it, the folks on shore don’t allow it.”
She added: “Now there are fewer fish. Life is hard. But we’ve got no education. All we can do is fish.”
These days, many Tanka prefer to call themselves “water-faring residents” — the term used in official documents — because the traditional word for them (“danjia” in Mandarin) can seem demeaning. Their origin is unclear, and theories abound. One traces them to ancient migrants from Southeast Asia.
Unlike most Chinese people, even in Cantonese-speaking Guangdong, few Tanka speak Mandarin, the dominant national language, and converse easily only in Cantonese.
“People onshore used to very much look down on the lives of the people living on boats,” said 
, a retired cultural affairs official in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, who has spent decades recording and preserving traditional Tanka saltwater songs and promoting their revival.
“This has left a big shadow in their hearts,” she said. “Many young people don’t know that their own parents were water-faring people.”
Until the 1950s, the Tanka were much more numerous along the south Chinese coast, and about 100,000 lived around Guangzhou. Besides fishing, they made a living rowing goods and people along the waterways around Guangzhou.
After the Communist Party came to power, there was talk that the Tanka might be listed as one of China’s official ethnic minorities, alongside Tibetans and other groups. They were instead categorized as an impoverished subclass of the Han majority, and the government began to move them onshore and put their children in schools.
But the Tanka on their boats remain a people apart, an underclass in the region’s economic boom. A few thousand of them still live on the water across southern China, although precise counts do not exist.
Many of them in Guangdong shuttle between small apartments and their houseboats, which they move up and down the coastal rivers to be near the best fishing.
“Before we could sing the saltwater songs, but very few people know them now — I don’t,” said Tam Wing-keung, 60, a fisherman. But he said fishing was in his bones. “Even if you threatened to kill me, I couldn’t do anything else,” he said. “This is my only skill.”","In China, an Ancient People Watch Their Floating Life Dissolve","JAN. 23, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/asia/china-tanka-river-people-datang.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"BEIJING — Sumi Jo, a 
-winning South Korean soprano, had been scheduled to perform alongside three top orchestras in mainland 
.
One venue billed the performance as a “grand and worthy” tribute to the beloved opera singer 
 by “one of the most sought-after Korean sopranos in the world.”
But on Sunday, about a month before the concerts were scheduled to take place, the three orchestras suddenly issued separate but seemingly coordinated notices announcing that Ms. Jo, a veteran coloratura soprano, would no longer be performing.
The cancellations have heightened suspicions that South Korean classical musicians are the latest casualties of political tensions with China that go back to July, when the government in Seoul announced that it would deploy 
 as Thaad on its soil.
In statements published on their official WeChat social media accounts, three orchestras — the Shanghai Symphony, the Guangzhou Symphony, and the China Philharmonic in Beijing — offered little or no explanation for why Ms. Jo would not be performing.
The China Philharmonic noted that Ms. Jo and the South Korean conductor Min Chung had been “forced to withdraw” from the performance for “specific reasons.”
For the concerts in Guangzhou and Shanghai, Ms. Jo will be replaced by the Chinese soprano Ying Huang. In Beijing, her spot will be filled by the Chinese soprano Liping Zhang, while the Chinese conductor Yang Yang will replace Mr. Chung.
The Xi’an Concert Hall has also removed from its online performance calendar information about a concert that had been scheduled for March 25 and that was to feature Ms. Jo. It was not part of the Callas tribute series.
Ms. Jo’s performances with the Hong Kong Philharmonic on Feb. 3 and 4 appear to be unaffected. The semiautonomous region has a separate visa application process.
The announcements on Sunday came just days after a performance by the South Korean pianist Kun-woo Paik and the Guiyang Symphony Orchestra, scheduled for March in the Chinese province of Guizhou, was abruptly called off on Wednesday.
Based on 
, it appears that Mr. Paik has been replaced in the program by the Chinese pianist Sa Chen.
“We never expected this to happen,” Ms. Jo’s brother, Jay Jo, said by telephone on Monday. “Sumi has toured nearly every year in China for almost 10 years.”
Many observers had been expecting various forms of Chinese retaliation after the announcement about the missile system. In August, several events in China featuring South Korean music and television stars were suddenly called off, setting off fears that 
, one of 
’s biggest cultural exports.
There has been no official confirmation of a Chinese blacklist or a ban on South Korean artists and entertainers. But “that’s the beauty of the Chinese government — they never say anything,” Mr. Jo said.
He added that the idea for the tribute concerts to Callas had been presented to Ms. Jo more than two years ago, and that the China tour dates had been confirmed in the summer.
When Ms. Jo was preparing to apply for an entry visa last month, Mr. Jo said, the Chinese orchestras were unable to provide the required government-approved invitation letter.
Reached by telephone on Monday, the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra declined to comment. The China Philharmonic Orchestra and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra did not respond to requests for comment sent by email and WeChat. The Chinese conductor Long Yu, who holds a leadership position in all three of the orchestras, did not respond to a call for comment.
Ms. Jo last performed in China in May, at a concert with the Spanish guitarist Pepe Romero at the National Center for Performing Arts in Beijing.
On Jan. 31, she will make her debut with the New York Philharmonic at its annual Chinese New Year concert. Mr. Yu will conduct.","3 Performances by Sumi Jo, Korean Soprano, Canceled in China","JAN. 23, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/asia/sumi-jo-soprano-maria-callas.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,AMY QIN
"LONDON — I’ve actually been watching the early Trump presidency from London. (I would have gone to the moon, but I couldn’t get a ride.) Even from here I have vertigo.
My head is swirling from “alternative facts,” trade deals canceled, pipelines initiated, Obamacare in the Twilight Zone and utterly bizarre rants about attendance on Inauguration Day and fake voters on Election Day. Whatever this cost Vladimir Putin, he’s already gotten his money’s worth — a chaos president. Pass the vodka.
But moderate Republicans, independents and Democrats who opposed Donald Trump need to beware. He can make you so nuts — he can so vacuum your brains out — that you can’t think clearly about the most important questions today: What things are true even if Trump believes them, and therefore merit support? And where can Democrats offer smarter approaches on issues, like jobs, for instance — approaches that can connect to the guts of working-class voters as Trump did, but provide a smarter path forward.
Where Trump’s instinct is not wrong is on the need to strike a better long-term trading arrangement with China. But I worry about his pugnacious tactics. I would be negotiating with Beijing in total secret. Let everybody save face. If he smacks China with “America First,” China will smack him with “China First,” and soon we’ll have a good ol’ trade war.
Where I think Democrats should focus their critique, and fresh thinking, is how we actually bring back more middle-class jobs. A day barely goes by without Trump threatening some company that plans to move jobs abroad or build a factory in Mexico, not America.
If Trump’s bullying can actually save good jobs, God bless him. But what Trump doesn’t see is that while this may get him some short-term jobs headlines, in the long-run C.E.O.s may prefer 
 to build their next factory in America, precisely because it will be hostage to Trump’s Twitter lashings. They also may quietly replace more workers with robots faster, because Trump can’t see or complain about that.
“Trump wants to protect jobs,” explained Gidi Grinstein, who heads the Israeli policy institute Reut. “What we really need is to protect workers.”
You need to protect workers, not jobs, because every worker today will most likely have to transition multiple times to multiple jobs as the pace of change accelerates. So the best way you help workers is by ensuring that they are flexible — that they have the skills, safety nets, health care and lifelong learning opportunities to make those leaps and that they live in cities open to innovation, entrepreneurship and high-I.Q. risk-takers.
The societal units protecting workers best are our healthy 
 — where local businesses, philanthropies, the public school system and universities, and local government come together to support a permanent education-to-work-to-life-long-skill-building pipeline.
Businesses signal to schools and colleges, in real time, the skills they need to thrive in the global economy, and philanthropies fund innovative programs for supplemental education and training. Schools also serve as adult learning and social service centers — and local and state governments support them all, including reaching out globally for investors and new markets.
Eric Beinhocker, executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at Oxford, calls this the “new progressive localism.” For too long, he argues, “progressives have been so focused on Washington, they’ve missed the fact that most of the progress on the issues they care about — environment, education, economic opportunity and work-force skills — has happened at the local level. Because that is where trust lives.” Trust is what enables you to adapt quickly and experiment often, i.e., to be flexible. And there is so much more trust on the local level than the national level in America today.
When Trump strong-arms a company to retain jobs, but kills Obamacare without a credible alternative, he is saving jobs but hurting workers, because he is making workers less secure and less flexible.
Another of Trump’s jobs fallacies is that regulation always holds companies back. In some cases it does, and thoughtful deregulation can help. But Trump’s argument that we must ignore climate science because steadily upgrading clean energy standards for our power, auto and construction companies kills jobs is pure nonsense.
Fact: California has some of the highest clean energy standards for cars, buildings and electric utilities in America. And those standards have kept California one of the world’s leaders in clean-tech companies and start-ups, and its jobs and overall economy have grown steadily since 2010.
“The Golden State has more than half a million advanced energy jobs,” says Energy Innovation C.E.O. Hal Harvey. “That’s 10 times more — in this state alone — than total U.S. coal jobs.” Trump’s strategy is to “make America last” on clean energy and to double down on coal. Insane.
In sum, Democrats should and can take the language of “strength” away from Trump and own it themselves. They should be for strong workers, not strong walls; for building strong communities, not relying on a strongman to strong-arm employers; and for strong standards to create strong companies. Those would be my fightin’ words.","Smart Approaches, Not Strong-Arm Tactics, to Jobs","JAN. 25, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/smart-approaches-not-strong-arm-tactics-to-jobs.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,
"WASHINGTON — President Trump upended America’s traditional, bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious, 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades.
With the stroke of a pen on his first full weekday in office, Mr. Trump signaled that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of his “America First” approach. In doing so, he demonstrated that he would not follow old rules, effectively discarding longstanding Republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and America — and that the United States should help write the rules of international commerce.
Although the Trans-Pacific Partnership had not been approved by Congress, Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama’s signature trade achievement, but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a fast-growing region. The deal, which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and 
 in a complex web of trade rules, was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising 
.
Instead, Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from low-wage countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, also parties to the deal.
But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward, and will expand its sway over Asia and beyond.
Monday was a busy day for the new president. In addition to abandoning the trade deal, he ordered a freeze on federal government hiring, except for the military and other security agencies. He 
 on federal funding for overseas family planning groups that assist or counsel women seeking abortions. He met with congressional, labor and business leaders. And he promised to cut up to 75 percent of federal regulations.
Mr. Trump’s decision to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or T.P.P., reversed a free-trade strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War, and aligned him more with the political left. When he told a meeting of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just terminated the pact, they broke into applause.
“We’re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it’s going to be reversed,” Mr. Trump told them, saying that from now on, the United States would sign trade deals only with individual allies. “I think you’re going to have a lot of companies come back to our country.”
Mr. Trump may also move quickly to renegotiate the 
. He is scheduling meetings with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the two main partners in that pact, which was negotiated by President George Bush and pushed through Congress by President Bill Clinton. While Nafta has been a major driver of American trade for nearly two decades, it has long been divisive, with critics blaming it for lost jobs and lower wages.
But free-trade advocates said that in canceling the Pacific pact, Mr. Trump lost an agreement that had already renegotiated Nafta under more modern rules governing intellectual property, internet access and agriculture, since both Mexico and Canada were signatories. He also undercut Mr. Obama’s so-called pivot to Asia and, critics said, essentially ceded the field to China, which was not part of the agreement.
“There’s no doubt that this action will be seen as a huge, huge win for China,” Michael B. Froman, the trade representative who negotiated the pact for Mr. Obama, said in an interview. “For the Trump administration, after all this talk about being tough on China, for their first action to basically hand the keys to China and say we’re withdrawing from our leadership position in this region is geostrategically damaging.”
Some Republicans agreed, but only a few would publicly challenge the president. Senator John McCain of Arizona called the decision “a serious mistake” that would hurt America. “It will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it,” he said in a statement.
The Obama administration negotiated the trade pact for nearly eight years. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other congressional Republicans worked with Mr. Obama to pass legislation granting so-called fast-track authority to negotiate it over Democratic objections. But Mr. Obama never submitted the final agreement for approval amid vocal opposition.
The agreement, the largest regional trade accord ever, 
 the United States and 11 other nations in a free-trade zone for about 40 percent of the world’s economy. It was intended to lower tariffs while establishing rules for resolving trade disputes, setting patents and protecting intellectual property.
Obama officials argued that it benefited the United States by opening markets while giving up very little in return. In particular, it finally brought the United States and Japan, the world’s largest and third-largest economies, together in a free-trade pact.
Mr. Trump’s decision was crushing for Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spent considerable political capital to get the agreement through Parliament, which ratified it Friday. Just hours before Mr. Trump dispensed with it, Mr. Abe told Parliament that Tokyo would lobby the new administration on the merits of the deal.
Japan was the last to join the pact, which would give its manufacturers tariff-free access to export markets in the United States and other Asian countries, but would bring its automakers into competition with lower-wage countries like Mexico. Mr. Abe became a strong enthusiast after making politically painful concessions on agricultural imports that the United States had sought.
China, by contrast, welcomed Mr. Trump’s move, although its leaders will probably relish the moment quietly. Given Mr. Trump’s harsh attacks on China and 
 of a leading China critic, Peter Navarro, to the new post of trade council director, Beijing is bracing for a potentially combative relationship.
Victor Shih, an expert on China’s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said withdrawing from the T.P.P. would alter America’s image in the region. “The U.S. will be seen as an unreliable partner both economically and perhaps even in the security arena,” he said. “While some countries in Asia have no choice but to be close to the U.S., others may begin to look to China.”
China has already sought to capitalize by making a push to complete an alternative pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which aims to unite 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India.
Australia’s trade minister, Steven Ciobo, said on Monday that other members of the trade pact were exploring whether to create a “T.P.P. minus one,” without the United States.
“The T.P.P. offers very material benefits for all parties that signed up for the agreement,” he said in an interview. “It would be a great shame to lose those benefits. Notwithstanding President Trump’s decision, there’s still a lot of merits to capturing those gains.”
If Mr. Trump scrambled coalitions overseas, he did so at home, too. Democrats and labor groups praised his move. James P. Hoffa, general president of the Teamsters union, said Mr. Trump had “taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies.” Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, said it would “bury the moldering corpse” of the Pacific deal, though she expressed concern about how Nafta would be renegotiated.
Some people emerging from the union meeting with Mr. Trump, who won surprising victories in Midwestern labor strongholds, expressed enthusiasm for both his trade action and his promise to build new roads, bridges and other infrastructure.
“We just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers,” Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, said. “We will work with him and his administration to help him implement his plans on infrastructure, trade and energy policy, so we really do put America back to work.”","Trump Abandons Trans-Pacific Partnership, Obama’s Signature Trade Deal","JAN. 23, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PETER BAKER
"HONG KONG — 
’s Lunar New Year fairs draw thousands of visitors who stroll past stalls of potted narcissus, snack on fish balls and snap up the latest plush toys. In recent years, the largest of the fairs, at Victoria Park, has also become a prime site for political expression.
Two years ago, after street protests failed to achieve greater public participation in the selection of the leader of Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, some holiday stalls offered clothing and other items carrying pointed 
. This year — before the March election of the leader in which the outcome will, as usual, be decided by pro-Beijing loyalists voting on a short list of vetted candidates — defiance appears to have given way to indignant resignation.
“I feel so helpless that as a Hong Konger, as a citizen, I don’t even have a vote,” said Priscilla Pang, a 22-year-old student, frowning at a wheel of fortune featuring the faces of several potential candidates for the leader, or chief executive. Given a choice, she would pick none of them, she said. “We’re like chickens having food forced down their throats. There’s no use fighting.”
The wheel of fortune was set up by the pro-democracy Civic Party to highlight the closed nature of the election, said Alvin Yeung, the party leader and a legislator.
“Most of the Hong Kong people who came and played the wheel, they don’t have the right to vote,” Mr. Yeung said. “We allow people to take their turn and see who will be the one, but at the end of the day our message is, ‘None of them are your real choice because this election is not a genuine election.’”
Nearby, a stall run by the Democratic Party was selling a modified version of Fish, Prawn, Crab, a Chinese game of chance. It, too, featured the expected candidates, with the winners determined by a roll of the dice. The point was that whichever candidate won, it was from the same restricted pool.
“Most people here will not be able to participate whatsoever,” said Helena Wong, a member of the Democratic Party, as she finished a “fai chun’’ — good wishes written in Chinese calligraphy on red paper — for display. “They can at most have fun playing the game.”
The declared candidates include three former government officials and a retired judge. All except the former judge, who is given little chance of winning, have embraced the 
 the Chinese government imposed in 2014 for changes to Hong Kong’s election rules. It allowed the chief executive to be elected, for the first time, by a popular vote. But the list of candidates would still be chosen by a pro-Beijing committee. It was that decision that led to the months of protests in Hong Kong, later known as the Umbrella Movement, calling for “genuine” universal suffrage.
Some leaders of the 2014 protests went on to 
 on the Legislative Council, Hong Kong’s 70-member legislature, but a sense of gloom was evident along the political aisle at the weeklong fair, where pro-democracy parties were calling for donations to fight a government-initiated 
 to their members’ qualifications to take office.
“Nathan Law could be stripped of his Legislative Council membership,” Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 protests who co-founded the Demosisto party with Mr. Law, shouted through a megaphone. “If — touch wood — he loses the case, he would go bankrupt.”
Mr. Law, who at 23 is the youngest person ever to have been elected to the Legislative Council, is among four pro-democracy legislators the government is trying to unseat over what it said were invalid 
. The move has stirred worries of a wider crackdown on opposition politicians, after the government 
 a similar, but separate, case that prevented two politicians who favor independence for Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, from taking seats in the Legislative Council.
In another blow to those two politicians, 
, known as Baggio, and 
, the Hong Kong government rescinded a permit for their party, Youngspiration, to set up a stall at Victoria Park less than a week before the opening of the fair. In a first, it cited the party’s pro-independence advocacy, saying visitors might “support or oppose the messages” of the party and thus “endanger public order and safety.” Another pro-independence party, the Hong Kong National Party, was also barred from the fair.
During New Year celebrations last year, in the Hong Kong district of Mong Kok, 
 broke out between the police and protesters who said they wanted to defend the New Year tradition of food hawkers’ selling fish balls and other street snacks. Although the hawkers were unlicensed, they were supported by Hong Kong residents who saw them as emblematic of local culture, which they feel is under threat. Many among the dozens of people arrested were connected to a 
.
Mr. Wong, a founder of Demosisto, said on Thursday that he was concerned that the authorities might broaden their crackdown on avowed separatists to those who seek greater democracy, with legal challenges and through other means.
“It set a very bad precedent,” he said in an interview, referring to the move to bar pro-independence parties from setting up shop at the fair, adding that he does not support independence for Hong Kong. “Today they banned pro-independence parties, tomorrow they could ban those supporting self-determination, and one day they can ban anyone who calls for universal suffrage and democracy.”
Despite the Hong Kong government’s apparent anxiety about the messages of opposing parties’ provoking violence, political adversaries have long coexisted peacefully at the Lunar New Year fair in Victoria Park.
This year, the stall of the staunchly pro-Beijing New People’s Party, featuring chicken-themed plush toys — the year that begins Friday night is the Year of the Rooster — stood alongside those of pro-democracy parties.
A makeshift museum at the fair featured 
, run by a group that condemns the Chinese Communist Party’s 
 and calls for an end to one-party rule.
From inside the museum, one could hear the music from a nearby miniconcert celebrating the approaching 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to the Chinese “motherland.”","At Hong Kong New Year Fair, Defiance Gives Way to Resignation","JAN. 27, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/world/asia/hong-kong-new-years-fair-election.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,ALAN WONG
"HONG KONG — Jack Ma has been in the global headlines lately for meeting with President Trump and for discussing world affairs at the 
 in Davos, Switzerland. But for the company he founded, the story is still at home.
On Tuesday, Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, 
 for its third quarter and beat analysts’ estimates. The quarter, which ended in December, is an essential one for the company: Its biggest 
 of the year is in November.
Nonetheless, the results showed how 
 — despite Mr. Ma’s global profile and its 
 in the United States — is still dependent on China. The results also demonstrate that while Alibaba’s global ambitions have made progress, they haven’t yet become a major driver of its results.
Of central concern to investors is the durability of Singles Day, a company-created, shopping-oriented “Hallmark holiday” that falls on Nov. 11 each year. While sales growth from that event has steadily slowed, leading the company to 
 around it, the holiday nonetheless drove earnings growth. In the quarter ending in December, Alibaba said revenue grew 54 percent, compared with the period a year earlier, to $7.7 billion. Net profit rose 38 percent, to nearly $2.5 billion.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Mr. Ma warned of the dangers of a trade war between the United States and China. With Mr. Trump, he asserted that his company would help create a million jobs in America. (Significantly, details were scant.)
His international appearances underscore a tough truth for Chinese internet companies: While they are often held up domestically as beacons of innovation, they have long struggled to build a 
. Alibaba has been trying to break that blockage, yet it has mostly focused on recruiting foreign brands to sell on its sites to Chinese consumers. In its third quarter, only 7 percent of its revenue came from commerce outside China.
One important way that Alibaba is looking to build its foreign businesses is by offering computing services to companies, much like Amazon does with Amazon Web Services. To that end, Alibaba has built new data centers around the world. Analysts are also bullish on the company’s cloud revenue, which in its third quarter more than doubled, to $254 million.
Investors have often looked to Alibaba to see 
. Alibaba has repeatedly argued that it should outperform the economy because online buyers have grown more quickly than total consumption. As that customer growth has slowed, Alibaba has worked to make more money from users, especially those using mobile phones. To that end, the company said the jump in revenue came from an increase in how much its online vendors spent per consumer as well as an increase in clicks because of improved targeting to customers.","Alibaba’s Profile Is Global, but Its Fate Is Tied to China","JAN. 24, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/business/alibaba-china-results-ma.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PAUL MOZUR
"his is the easiest place to live in the world,” said the dark-haired woman with a nose ring and London accent who was cutting my hair the day I arrived in Sydney two weeks ago. Compared with Morocco, England and a few other places she used to call home, Australia was clearly the most relaxed, she said, and perhaps the hardest to engage.
“It’s so nice here. It’s hard to get people to think about all the terrible things in the world,” she said. Then she laughed: “Or maybe it’s just my friends; maybe you’ll find a different crowd.”
To some degree, we hope to actually bring those crowds together — to get the disengaged and the engaged talking to us, and one another. We’re early on in the process of opening a new bureau in Sydney — I’m the bureau chief — and expanding our coverage of a place that is sometimes called 
 for many, because of its blinding beauty and resource-rich fortunes; for others, including the writer who 
, because of its ongoing effort to define itself beyond the accident of its location and youth as a nation.
Our own goals are relatively universal: We want to do irresistible in-depth journalism. We want to connect with audiences, working with sources, readers and creators to build a body of work that explores, investigates and highlights what matters in Australia, to Australians and to the world. And we want to connect readers in Australia to the best work of Times journalists around the globe.
As part of that, we have some ambitious plans that we’ll tell you about as they come together. 
 There’s a process that goes into covering a new country as a foreign correspondent; in my 12 years at The Times, I’ve done it in Mexico, Haiti and Cuba as well as in Iraq and Lebanon, and a big part of it involves listening. It’s reading books, it’s watching movies, it’s interviewing everyone from bartenders, hairstylists and taxi or Uber drivers (who seem to be remarkably well informed about American politics, by the way) to novelists, artists and political figures of varying views.
Usually that all happens offscreen. 
 I’d love your suggestions for what I should be reading. I’m currently halfway into “Cloudstreet” by Tim Winton, which is fantastic, but what should I add to my list? Who should I meet? What themes should The Times make sure it doesn’t overlook?
Initially, this newsletter, which we’ve been testing a few different ways, will be a platform for that exploration. It will often be me or one of my colleagues writing about what we’re noticing, and asking questions. We’ll also show you a few stories we’ve done or liked, and find ways to toss in a little fun.
That’s just a start. We’re 
 and 
 for projects so there will be more to read and see once we really get going.
But enough throat-clearing. Even as we grow, we’ll be committing regular acts of journalism. Jacqueline Williams, an investigative journalist originally from Canberra, is here now, joining me from New York, and Michelle Innis, a born-and-raised Sydney-sider, continues to provide a steady stream of news and features about Australia — not to mention all the other things The Times has to offer about Washington and the world.
Here are a few stories, not all having to do with The Lucky Country, that I found striking in recent weeks, followed by a perhaps surprising

 erased that with 
. Long-serving American officials in the region are none too pleased and predict 
 will fill the void; critics of multilateral trade deals say it’s about time someone stiffens policy on behalf of American workers. But this is really just the start of a foreign policy shake-up in Washington that will ripple through the entire world, including Australia. Here’s a 
 at how China may be interpreting what’s going on.

The headline on 
 from The Interpreter, a column by Max Fisher and Amanda Taub that uses context and history to explain world events (sign up 
 for their newsletter), focuses on what the United States gets for defending its allies around the world. It could just as easily emphasize what the world receives from the U.S. Either way, what you’re left with is a portrait of interlocking alliances and exchanges that have managed to keep much of the world in relative peace and economic harmony — well, at least for the elites.

I’m one of many Americans who come from a politically divided working-class family.

One of our goals here is to connect Australia to the world by being more inclusive of Australia in our coverage and (if possible) creating journalism that helps put Australia in perspective. This 
 features protests in Sydney and Melbourne. It’s also visually arresting, easy to understand and global in scope — appropriate to the size and scale of the protests.

As you may have noticed, our itinerant 
, Lucas Peterson, has been bouncing around Australia recently. 
 really grabbed me — as a look at street art and its many forms in Melbourne. I’ve often found that artists can tell you more about a country than politicians, and I also appreciated Lucas’s approach: “Find complete strangers that appear to be local residents and ask what they enjoy about the city.” That pretty much sums up what I plan to do as I get started in Sydney, and all over this vast country: Ask what people love, and also what they want investigated and explored. Tell me on Twitter (@damiencave) or by email (nytaustralia@nytimes.com).

Finally, here’s some topical and meaningful fun.
This week, in the world of politics and media, there’s been a lot of discussion about facts, 
, and 
, and it’s been framed in stark black and white terms: truth, it would seem, is obvious.
But when should we trust the facts we think we know?
For some things — 
 for one — what we see is what we get. But with our memories, facts are eels, slippery and fast, which led me back to what I still think of as the most creative bit of fact-bending storytelling that I’ve seen in five, maybe 10 years: “
.” It’s Sarah Polley investigating her own family, and her documentary’s themes of betrayal and curiosity are as universal as her filmmaking is unpredictable and surprising.
No, it’s not an escape (for that, there’s 
); it’s a dive into the mysterious foggy abyss of facts and alternatives. And it’s worth it.",Australia: The Lucky Country,"JAN. 24, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/australia/australia-newsletter-issue1-the-lucky-country-trump-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,DAMIEN CAVE
"BEIJING — President Trump and the Chinese president, 
, are in a bind. Mr. Trump’s slogan is to “Make America Great Again,” while Mr. Xi’s motto is “Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.” The phrases have the same meaning: Each leader suggests his country has declined and claims that he will restore it to the top position in the world. But the triumph of one country is built on the failure of the other. It’s a zero-sum game.
Mr. Trump’s move on Monday to 
 — an Obama administration trade proposal meant to strengthen America’s economic power at 
’s expense — leaves little doubt that the president will follow through with his campaign promises to upend American trade policies, including those toward China. Taken with Mr. Trump’s postelection 
 with the leader of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, a 
, we can expect a jolt to United States-China relations.
But while a trade war, military skirmishes in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, or other diplomatic crises could cause a hiccup in China’s rise, the Trump era will offer plenty of opportunities for Beijing. China has a chance to become a full-fledged superpower if it responds to the Trump presidency by opening up more to the world economically and politically.
China has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalization, which helped bring hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty in the past three decades. And as much as Mr. Trump would like to freeze the forces of free trade, the world will keep globalizing.
Mr. Trump’s scrapping of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a chance for Beijing to strengthen its position as the economic leader of East Asia by bolstering regional trade. China is party to a free-trade agreement with Southeast Asian nations, and Beijing should encourage South Korea and Australia to join that pact. Japan is reluctant to become part of a trade group that includes China, so Beijing should leave Tokyo behind.
The Chinese leadership should also end its long-held policy of avoiding formal alliances. As the Trump administration signals it may ignore Beijing’s 
 and treat Taiwan as an independent country, potentially upending the bedrock of American-Chinese relations since 1979, Beijing should establish military alliances with as many neighbors as possible. China has so-called strategic partnerships with most of its neighbors, but only Pakistan is a traditional military ally.
If China were to form meaningful bilateral military pacts with Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and especially the Philippines, America would have more difficulty joining a potential war in the Taiwan Strait — a very real possibility given Mr. Trump’s threats to the status quo.
An East Asian trade agreement and a raft of new formal alliances would help Beijing take the position as the leader of East Asia and make the region safer.
Mr. Trump’s antidemocratic tendencies in the domestic arena, along with his threats to build a wall across America’s border with Mexico, offer another opportunity for China in immigration policy.
An illiberal turn in the United States could drive talented Americans to seek careers abroad, while skilled workers the world over may start looking somewhere other than the United States to make a better life. By adopting a more open policy toward immigrants — including the creation of a path to citizenship for some categories of immigrants — China could expand its economy while improving its moral standing globally. In doing so, Beijing could greatly reduce America’s soft-power advantage.
On the bilateral front, a trade war between China and the United States seems likely under Mr. Trump. Still, Beijing should be considering ways to reduce its trade surplus with the United States and avoid a battle. Meanwhile, if the Chinese bought fewer American bonds, the Trump administration would find it harder to pay for its plans to rebuild domestic infrastructure.
There are signs that the Chinese leadership is already stepping in to fill the leadership void developing under Mr. Trump’s presidency. Last week, Mr. Xi 
at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, recommitting China to globalization and free trade. China is also poised to take a leading role in 
, given Mr. Trump’s hostility toward climate agreements.
Relations between China and the United States will inevitably deteriorate with Mr. Trump at the helm. The nuclear deterrent should still prevent an all-out war, but confrontation will be the core of these two giants’ relationship for the foreseeable future.",China Can Thrive in the Trump Era,"JAN. 25, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/china-can-thrive-in-the-trump-era.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,YAN XUETONG
"FULING, China — Tree-carpeted mountains rise high in this sleepy Yangtze River district, best known for its crunchy pickled mustard tubers. But one of these mountains is not like the others.
On the peak of Jinzi Mountain in Fuling, a single chimney stands sentinel over the adjacent Wu River. The chimney has been idle since it was built decades ago. Only in recent years has the public learned why.
Fifteen years ago, the local government announced that inside the hollowed-out mountain lay the remnants of what was once one of China’s most ambitious military infrastructure projects: the top-secret 816 nuclear plant.
Initiated in the 1960s during the height of tensions between China and the Soviet Union, the 816 project was China’s first attempt to build a nuclear reactor that could produce weapons-grade plutonium without Soviet involvement.
But there was one catch. To reduce the possibility of an attack, Chinese officials and engineers made the unusual decision to place the reactor underground, complicating an already challenging engineering process.
Over the next 18 years, more than 60,000 workers participated in the risky project, and some died in the process. The result was what is said to be the world’s largest artificial cave, able to withstand the force of thousands of tons of explosives as well as a magnitude 8 earthquake. But when China began a sweeping civilian defense conversion of many of its military projects in the early 1980s, work on the nearly finished plant was abruptly called to a halt.
For 26 years, it functioned partly as a chemical fertilizer factory before being 
 in 2010 — an improbable twist of fate for this quirk of Cold War history.
Still, for many former workers, the 816 project remains a source of bitter regret. Even as China charges ahead with an ambitious — if controversial — 
 around the country and expand the use of 
, once-important military nuclear projects like 816 have all but been forgotten.
“Back then, the project took so much from these young men, including our livelihoods,” said Chen Huaiwen, 69, a former soldier who worked on the excavation of the mountain from 1969 to 1974. “We need to make this clear to the public. Otherwise it will have been a huge waste of our efforts and manpower.”
To address these concerns, the 816 site recently underwent a year of renovations. Since it reopened in September, visitors — including, for the first time, foreigners — can now see about one-third of the cave, which contains nearly 13 miles of tunnel roads.
On a recent afternoon, a group of tourists, led by an energetic tour guide who came dressed in military fatigues and combat boots, clambered onto a golf cart at the roadside entrance of one of the tunnels. From there, the cart burrowed straight into the belly of Jinzi Mountain, cool air whooshing by.
At the tour’s first stop, a cavernous hall that once held the plant’s power-generation facilities, ominous doomsday music blared while neon lights bathed the concrete-walled room in blue, red and then pink. It was a scene that was perhaps more befitting of an underground rave than a Communist history education tour, apart from a display that showed, among other things, an image of a mushroom cloud from China’s first nuclear test at Lop Nur in 1964.
Speaking into a microphone, Qi Hong, the tour guide, explained: “This cave represents not only the efforts of the 816 workers but also an important part of history in China’s national defense and nuclear development.”
Standing around Ms. Qi were 30 or so mostly older Chinese. Throughout the 90-minute tour, Ms. Qi led the group through a maze of empty reactor halls, exhibition rooms and dim staircases, stopping frequently to lecture so the elderly visitors could catch their breath.
Although most in the group had not heard of the project until recently, they were old enough to recall the historical circumstances that led the government to single out this picturesque place in southwestern China — also the backdrop of the writer Peter Hessler’s best-selling memoir “River Town” — as the site of a massive nuclear complex.
It began, Ms. Qi explained, with the Third Front, the colossal defense program started by China in 1964 to create an industrial base in the country’s interior. China already had a nuclear reactor — the Soviet-designed 404 project in the northwestern province of Gansu. But as concerns grew about that reactor’s vulnerability to attack, in 1966 Premier Zhou Enlai personally approved the plan to build a replica of the 404 project underground in Fuling.
Soon after, scientists, engineers, soldiers and other supporting staff came from all around the country to this remote area — then reachable only by boat — to work on the 816 project. They represented some of the nation’s top talent, having studied at China’s leading universities, as well as in the Soviet Union and Japan.
“The plant reflects the greatness of the Chinese people,” said Xia Renhui, 66, a retiree from the northeastern city of Shenyang who was touring the plant. “And now, China is even stronger. Obama’s Army is not good enough to fight us!”
From the beginning, it was a top-secret project. Locals and even many of the soldiers working at the site were unaware of the project’s true purpose. The complex included schools, a market and a hospital so the workers could live in total isolation. The nearby town of Baitao disappeared from the map.
“All we knew was the code name 816,” said Li Tingyong, a local resident and later head of the Fuling tourism bureau, in a 
 about the 816 plant. “But we had no idea what it was a code name for. It was very mysterious.”
Life was especially hard for the more than 20,000 young soldiers. Many had enlisted thinking they were heading to Beijing, only to find that they had been assigned to work at the 816 project site. For a small monthly salary of around 6 renminbi, or $2.44 at the time, the soldiers — whose average age was 21 — were tasked with excavating the hard rock with only small drills, dynamite and shovels.
It was dangerous work, and the pressure to finish the project was immense. Soldiers worked around the clock, urged on by the slogan “Fight the clock against imperialism, revisionism and counterrevolutionaries!” Many were injured or died. Today official figures put the number of fatalities at around 100.
“But I don’t believe it,” said Ms. Qi, in a rare departure from her script, suggesting the real number was higher. “The environment was too harsh.”
By the time the project was called off in 1984, 85 percent of the construction had been finished. Over all, total investment in the 816 project is estimated at more than 746 million renminbi, or about $359 million at the time.
But sunk costs aside, some experts say the decision to abandon the 816 project was ultimately a sound one.
“The only good thing that happened with the project was that they didn’t finish it,” said Hui Zhang, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s Project on Managing the Atom. “In terms of the overall development of China’s nuclear program, the 816 project really did not contribute anything.”
Still, for many of the people like Mr. Chen, who gave years of their lives to the 816 project, a sense of loss and resentment lingers.
“Ultimately we worked on the project because we thought we were working for the nation,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview as he traveled home to Shanxi Province after visiting the reopened plant. “If we knew that in the end it would be made into a tourist site, we never would have participated.”","A Chinese Nuclear Site, Hidden in a Mountain, Is Reborn as a Tourist Draw","JAN. 24, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/asia/china-fuling-nuclear-816.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,AMY QIN
"BEIJING — For 
, President Trump’s scrapping of the American-brokered Pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend Beijing’s economic and political influence. And it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in Asia.
But with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership shake-up, the last thing President 
 wants is a trade war, though officials are girding for that possibility. Rather, China’s leaders crave stability and predictability.
Early signs indicate they may not get their wish. The Chinese fear that if Mr. Trump was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of American trade policy, he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with Beijing, including Taiwan and the South China Sea.
As if to bolster that point, on Monday — the same day that Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement — his spokesman said the United States would prevent China from accessing islands it claims in the South China Sea, a threat that one nationalist Chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war.
“This shows that Trump might act on his words,” Deng Yuwen, a public affairs commentator in Beijing, said in an interview. “With previous presidents, their election promises weren’t taken so seriously.”
He added, “That means China must take his other warnings more seriously, especially about the South China Sea and Taiwan.”
Mr. Trump’s goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect American jobs and businesses. His trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the United States or to contain China, which was not invited to join the agreement.
But in killing an agreement designed to limit China’s vast economic reach in Asia and anchor America’s presence in the world’s fastest growing region, analysts said, Mr. Trump created a void that President Xi was already practicing to fill.
Only last week, Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, suggesting that with the United States in retreat, China was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment.
Mr. Xi has kept China’s economy behind high walls, and China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president.
“This is indeed a big win for China in the struggle for global leadership,” said Zhang Baohui, director of the center for Asia Pacific studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “Trump is surrendering this opportunity to prove the continuing relevance of American primacy.”
The death of the trade agreement is likely to accelerate Beijing’s push for its alternative trade agreement, the China-centered Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
That agreement would exclude the United States and would reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade among China, Southeast Asian nations, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. It includes few of the features of T.P.P. that would have been most awkward for Beijing, such as protections for independent labor unions and the environment, and requirements that state-owned enterprises behave more like commercial enterprises.
The agreement has stalled on rifts between Southeast Asian nations and the others, but Thailand’s minister of commerce, Apiradi Tantraporn, said Monday that the talks “are expected to be expedited” without the T.P.P.
But the end of the T.P.P. will not be Mr. Trump’s last word on trade with China.
His trade officials say they expect greater access to the Chinese market in exchange for the easy access Chinese goods have to the United States. And they appear prepared to risk a trade war, an expanding tit-for-tat contest of tariffs and other trade restrictions, to get it.
Mr. Trump’s trade officials have threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, starting with heavily subsidized products such as steel and aluminum, imported into the United States. “It’s a little weird that we have very low tariffs and China has very high tariffs,” Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary, said at his Senate confirmation hearing last week.
Last week, China proposed allowing 
, but there was little confidence the recommendations would be carried out in the foreseeable future, and American businesses said they 
 than before.
While Mr. Trump’s advisers say that China has more to lose than the United States in a trade war, Chinese officials told visiting American businessmen last week that Beijing was prepared. They had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the United States if Washington took the initiative, they said.
“The signals are very clear: If this is going to be a trade war, China will reduce imports of American aircraft from Boeing and agricultural products,” said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “We can turn to Europe, Australia and Canada for those products. And we know that 20 to 30 of the states in the United States with big agricultural lobbies and Boeing plants will be putting pressure on Congress.”
A long-serving American trade expert in China agreed, saying China was prepared to go to the mat.
“Trump’s trade team would be wise to shelve ‘The Art of the Deal’ and focus on the ‘Art of War,’ if they really want to know what’s ahead in U.S.-China trade relations,” said James Zimmerman, a managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton who has worked in China for 19 years. “China views Trump as a paper tiger that will likely back down on the complicated, thorny issues that are not negotiable. The Chinese also know that Trump won’t risk a trade war lest the business community will be up in arms.”
Others, though, detect anxiety, and read China’s outward confidence as bluster. Bilahari Kausikan, ambassador at large for Singapore, said China had “a real insecurity about a trade war.”
Both sides are likely to lose, he said, but China stands to lose more “since the U.S. domestic political order is not at stake in the same way as the Chinese Communist Party rule may be at stake.”
The next few months, as Mr. Xi focuses on choosing new members of the ruling Standing Committee for his second five-year term, will be a particularly tense political period, and economic instability is the last thing he needs. Similarly, he will try at all costs to appear strong to his domestic, nationalistic audience in the face of challenges from Mr. Trump on Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Mr. Trump has suggested that the One China policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, is not sacrosanct, a major concern for Mr. Xi.
“In a year of political transition, Xi cannot afford to come across as weak,” said 
, the director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, who served as China director for the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. “Taiwan is the core of core issues for China — a bottom line. Many Chinese stress that it is nonnegotiable.”
But for now, at least, the increased contention with Washington is likely to strengthen Mr. Xi’s political hand at home by rallying public and elite support against a foreign threat, said 
, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics and Chinese-American relations.
“Short term, it will almost certainly give the Chinese government a boost in its public support,” Dr. Pei said in a telephone interview. “It helps Xi, because whenever there is such pressure from outside, Chinese officials tend to rally around the top leader.”
Mr. Trump has also threatened China on control of territory it claims in the South China Sea. The comments by Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Monday echoed those made by his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, at his Senate confirmation hearing.
While Mr. Trump has not explained how he will keep China off islands where it has built airstrips and installed weapons, the comments by his appointees suggest the possibility of an American blockade. While Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to leverage American allies in the region to compel China to back down, Mr. Trump seems willing to abandon them and face China on his own.
That go-it-alone attitude has raised alarms at the Pentagon and among American Navy experts, who said such a blockade would be tantamount to war. The idea has also alarmed America’s allies.
Australia, Washington’s staunchest ally in the Asia Pacific region, would not participate in such a venture, its defense officials said, adding that a blockade could not be successful and could serve to persuade disenchanted American friends in the Asia Pacific to pivot toward China.
With Mr. Trump portending divisive action on many fronts, Mr. Xi was calm and prepared, his foreign minister, Wang Yi, suggested.
“Serene under the tumultuous clouds,” Mr. Wang said, quoting a line from a poem by Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist China.

"Work may indeed be coming back to the United States. The real issue is whether human beings will do it.
As Farhad Manjoo 
, American manufacturers now produce over 80 percent more than they did in 1987, using just two-thirds as many workers. The reason is automation, and here, political browbeating comes up against the laws of economics — robots are cheaper and often more efficient than people.
Farhad’s statistic looks over a 30-year period. That underplays more recent advances like cheap and abundant sensors, cloud-connected computing systems and better algorithms. All of those things mean that robots are getting better at a fast rate. Throw in artificial intelligence, and robots are even faster at doing ordinary human tasks.
That’s why we now see factories with just 
 and lots of machines. Even the cloud data centers that sometimes power the robots 
. They are usually located in rural areas, sometimes in the shells of old factories, but they are full of robots.
If you believe lots of Americans should work in American factories, it gets worse. As Farhad notes, many of the robots that are doing American work are built in China. China, eager to keep people employed and stay on top of all manufacturing, has made a business of making robots. Farhad doesn’t say whether the robot factories are automated.
So, how bad is this for American workers? Maybe not dire. According to 
, robots are likely to take away parts of tasks, but not entire jobs. People need to learn to work alongside robots.
Additionally, a big reason to have automated factories in the United States, instead of manufacturing in China, is to have a better grip on quality control and local distribution to major customers. That means jobs in operations management, loading and shipping. (Self-driving trucks are still a long way off, whatever the visionaries say.)
Then there is the prospect that factories, like farms before them, will become largely automated and that people will find other work. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, 
, has called this “
,” which he sees as a global challenge to make people better at new science and math.
There is also evidence that our highly automated, digital society has come to value human moments. Think of the rise of artisanal beers, the boom in personal trainers or the rising prices for live music. They are all signs that 
 people pay for have become exactly what a robot can never be: human.
We can build a society of work around that, perhaps. At least until they build a robot that grows a nice, bushy, authentic-seeming beard, lives in Brooklyn and makes handcrafted cabinets. No sign of that out of China.",Daily Report: American Jobs and Chinese Robots,"JAN. 25, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/technology/daily-report-american-jobs-and-chinese-robots.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,QUENTIN HARDY
"Factories play a central role in President Trump’s parade of American horrors. In his telling, globalization has left our factories “shuttered,” “rusted-out” and “scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.”
Here’s what you might call an alternative fact: American factories still make a lot of stuff. In 2016, the United States hit a manufacturing record, producing more goods than ever. But you don’t hear much gloating about this because manufacturers made all this stuff without a lot of people. Thanks to automation, 
, but with only two-thirds the number of workers.
This suggests that while Mr. Trump can browbeat manufacturers into staying in America, he can’t force them to hire many people. Instead, 
.
And there’s another wrinkle to this story: The robots won’t be made in America. They might be made in China.
Industrial robots — which come in many shapes and perform a range of factory jobs, from huge, precisely controlled arms used to build cars to graceful 
 — were invented in the United States. But in the last few years the Chinese government has spent billions to turn China into the world’s robotic wonderland.
In 2013, China became the world’s largest market for industrial robots, according to the International Federation of Robotics, an industry trade group. Now China is working on another big goal: to become the largest producer of robots used for factories, agriculture and a range of other applications.
Robotics industry experts said that goal could be a decade away, but they see few impediments to China’s eventual dominance.
“If you look at the comparisons in investment between China and the U.S., we’re going to lose,” said Henrik Christensen, director of the Contextual Robotics Institute at the University of California, San Diego. “The investments in China are billions and billions. I’m not seeing that investment in the U.S. And without that investment, we are going to lose. No doubt.”
There’s a way to address this problem, but it’s politically perilous: The United States should invest in robots. Mark Cuban, the internet and sports entrepreneur (and Trump nemesis), recently called on the president to offer 
 Frank Tobe, the publisher and editor of a trade magazine called The Robot Report, said government investment was imperative.
“We better do something, or we’re going to be behind the gun,” he said. “We should be in the robot business, not just users of foreign robots.”
If we don’t, robot scholars said the president’s plans for a resurgence in manufacturing could backfire. Today, we buy a lot of stuff made in China by Chinese people. Tomorrow, we’ll buy stuff made in America — by Chinese robots.
How China learned to love robots is instructive. For years, China’s chief selling point was cheap labor. But over the last couple of decades, its population has gotten older and richer, and 
. Chinese leaders worried that manufacturers would get priced out. In the same way that America lost manufacturing to China, Chinese manufacturers would lose work to India, Vietnam and other developing Asian economies.
So the Chinese did what the Chinese do: They centrally planned a revival. Over a succession of five-year economic plans, the government pushed a series of manufacturing reforms. One of its central ideas is automation. Local governments 
 for companies to buy and manufacture robots. The government has been especially interested in building robots that can be installed in China’s car factories, which have been criticized for poor workmanship. Robots that build cars would not just save labor costs; the government also believes they would build better cars. In 2014, Xi Jinping, China’s president, called for 
Like other centrally planned initiatives, China’s robotics initiatives have not proceeded without trouble. There have been overinvestment and waste, and many Chinese robotics companies aren’t making very good robots.
“Many are low quality, and safety and design standards are really not good,” said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, an organization that aims to improve Asian-American relations. “There are supposedly a bit more than 100 Chinese robot companies. I would say about 50 of these companies may survive.”
But the Chinese government and its companies are persistent. Mr. Ernst expects slow, steady gains in the Chinese robotics industry. And in five to 10 years, he predicts, China’s robot business will be producing industrial robots that are on par with those from Germany and Japan.
Pushing a robotics revival in the United States would be more difficult than in China, where there hasn’t been much outcry from workers over the government’s embrace of automation.
“There is not a public conversation in China about the pluses and minuses of automation,” said Scott Kennedy, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They don’t talk about the losers in society from globalization or potential automation.”
In the United States, on the other hand, losing is all we seem to talk about. Mr. Trump rose to power in part because he crystallized a feeling among voters that we have lost our edge to China. He promised to bring jobs back to America. In a hot-take political climate that can’t stomach nuance, an investment in robots would be seen as a betrayal of the manufacturing workers he promised to save.
But that would be a mistake. Mr. Christensen of the University of California, San Diego, pointed out that even the most automated of factories still employ people. To the extent that an investment in robotics might make it easier for companies to build their factories in the United States rather than in China, it might well create new jobs in the United States.
What’s more, America enjoys many advantages in robotics that China lacks. Some of the world’s leading roboticists work at American universities. The United States has a start-up culture that knows how to create big new companies. And America has a head start in the most advanced robotics technologies. For instance, American companies are the leading purveyors of surgical robots, and they are at the forefront of “collaborative robotics,” in which robots can work side by side with humans.
“All of this robotics technology was invented in the U.S., but we basically let other companies take it from us and make it cheaper, and now we’re buying it from them,” Mr. Christensen said. “In some sense, we’re not being very good at making sure we remain competitive in areas that we’re leading.”
And that’s how huge government funding can help, the robot experts said. As in China, an infusion from Mr. Trump could turn some of the most far-out ideas in robotics into a structural advantage for the American economy.
“What we can learn from the Chinese example is that the government plays a nurturing and fostering role for developing the robotics industry,” Mr. Ernst said. “We can do the same. We must do the same.”",How to Make America’s Robots Great Again,"JAN. 25, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/technology/personaltech/how-to-make-americas-robots-great-again.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,Farhad Manjoo
"The period of “reform and opening up” that began in December 1978 under the Chinese leader 
 is widely seen as the foundation of today’s 
, with its socialist market economy. The influence of Western economists on Chinese experiments at that time is a little-known aspect of the history. 
’s “
,” published this month by Harvard University Press, looks at some of the ideas and relationships that paved the way for China’s transformation. In an interview, Mr. Gewirtz, who is a Rhodes scholar and doctoral candidate in history at the University of Oxford, discussed the lessons for China and the United States today.
The Chinese engaged with an extraordinary range of foreign economists. Some of the most influential had grown up in socialist systems and knew firsthand about transitions away from central planning. These people included the Hungarian Harvard professor 
, the Czech émigré 
 and the Polish-born Oxford don 
. But 
 also called for the study of “the successful experiences of capitalist countries.” Thus, economists such as the American Nobel laureates 
 and 
 were also invited to China for high-level engagements.
The Chinese learned a great deal from these foreign economists, but they did not seek simply to copy Western ideas. So-called “influence” in this period was a process of constantly negotiated receptivity and debate about new ideas. And the Chinese side was firmly in charge.
I was particularly interested in the close relationship between Kornai and the leading Chinese reformer 
. They met at a conference in Athens in 1981, the year after Kornai published his seminal book “Economics of Shortage.” Wu was immediately impressed by the relevance to China of Kornai’s ideas about chronic shortages and how the “investment hunger” of state-owned enterprises distorts an economy.
They continued to meet and share ideas, and Wu used Kornai’s ideas to shape the policies of the mixed system that still governs China’s economy today, dubbed a socialist market economy.
These personal stories remind us that people operating under real-life constraints, rather than disembodied ideas or historic “forces,” are what make history. Kornai and Wu remain friends and even celebrated their birthdays together in Beijing in 2008.
The S.S. Bashan was the deliberately secluded setting of a weeklong conference that brought together many of those tasked with leading China’s reforms and an intellectually diverse array of foreign economists, including Kornai, Brus, the Scottish economist Sir Alec Cairncross and the American Nobel laureate James Tobin. The World Bank and Chinese officials planned the conference at the direct orders of Premier 
, who met with the group in Beijing before they headed off on the cruise.
Tobin taught what was essentially Macroeconomics 101. Kornai proposed that China build an economic system in which enterprises would respond to market pressures but the state could still manage macroeconomic policy and regulate the market. The cruise also offered the Chinese officials — few of whom had lived in a modern market economy — a chance to see how prominent international economists thought about problems and advised on policy. It was perhaps the single most important of the many intensive intellectual exchanges that Zhao oversaw and was frequently referenced in deliberations at the time. It’s an event that’s emblematic of the broader pragmatic, eclectic open-mindedness of this period.
Deng has deservedly received a great deal of credit for China’s extraordinary transformation, but historians are showing that this account is incomplete. One figure who doesn’t get the credit he deserves is Zhao Ziyang, who was premier and then general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao oversaw and directed the development of many market-oriented policies that powered growth, and he set out a vision of a system in which, as he put it in 1987, “the state manages the market, and the market guides the enterprises.” But Zhao was removed from power in 1989, just before the Tiananmen tragedy, because he opposed imposing martial law. Today, his name almost never appears in print in China. The party takes credit for his achievements or attributes them to Deng.
Of course, we should never forget that while these policies and leaders mattered greatly, the engine of China’s transformation was the ingenuity and hard work of the Chinese people.
Xi’s regime has taken deeply troubling steps to wall off academia, the media, the professions, the internet and much of society. This history suggests that the costs of these policies may be high. Over the past 40 years, the exchanges between the U.S. and China have not just been in economic goods and services, but also in economic ideas. That openness to new ideas from around the world has greatly benefited China’s quest for greater wealth and power.
Without that openness, China will miss out on exactly the kind of interchanges that Deng and reformers of his era believed were essential to China’s success. Worst of all, it intensifies the chilling effect on thinking and policy making within China, discouraging experimentation and innovation when it is urgently needed.
 presented China as the world’s new champion of “openness” and “globalization.” But, in fact, China’s leaders are not encouraging Chinese openness to foreign ideas. And China’s economy is still far less open to foreign investment than the U.S. and many other countries.
Recent history certainly suggests that stronger measures are overdue to help correct economic imbalances and especially the lack of access to many segments of the Chinese market that U.S. companies experience. But the worst-case scenario is a series of drastic measures that devolve into a mutually 
. The U.S. should seek to remedy China’s unfair trade practices and destabilizing security provocations while projecting strength and protecting its interests and values in the Asia-Pacific, but not in a spirit of demonizing China or undermining important cooperation between our two countries.
Even after President Trump’s 
, the U.S. should seek to develop its role in Asia’s regional economy, but not in a spirit of excluding China. The United States needs to work with China to solve nearly every major global problem, and our prosperity is still inextricably intertwined, even if some in President Trump’s circle would prefer to think otherwise.
One of the basic assumptions underpinning U.S.-China relations has been that, on the whole, openness and interconnection lead to stability and prosperity. The Trump presidency

"BEIJING — On a windswept lot near Beijing’s main airport, Lu Qun talks up the electric sports car he hopes will transform him into China’s Elon Musk.
“This is a real performance car,” the entrepreneur boasted of his sleek, gray-and-black Qiantu K50. “It’s fun. You can feel the quality. You’ll love driving this car.”
For Mr. Lu, 48, the roadster is his best chance to make it big. After a lifetime of obscurity creating vehicles for other companies, the bespectacled engineer is betting that the rise of 
 will propel his company — and his country — into the automotive spotlight.
“Traditional auto manufacturers are constrained by their old models,” he said. “We can see things with fresh eyes.”
Across China, government officials, corporate executives, private investors and newcomers like Mr. Lu are in a headlong rush to develop a domestic electric car industry. The country’s goal, like Mr. Lu’s, is to capitalize on the transition to electric to turbocharge the country’s lagging automobile sector to become a major competitor to the United States, Japan and Germany.
That has been a goal of China’s industrial planners for decades, as the government has lavished resources on building homegrown automakers and discriminated against foreign players.
But so far, that effort has failed.
Local manufacturers have lacked the brands, technology and managerial heft to outmaneuver their established rivals, either at home or abroad. Chinese consumers have preferred more reliable Buicks, Volkswagens and Toyotas to the often substandard offerings from domestic manufacturers, while little-known Chinese models have struggled to gain traction overseas.
Electric vehicles could offer a second chance — one China’s policy makers do not intend to miss.
They targeted electric cars for special support in an industrial policy called “
,” which aims to foster upgraded, technologically advanced manufacturing. By 2020, Beijing expects its automakers to be able to churn out two million electric and hybrid vehicles annually — six times the number produced in 2015.
This time, China’s carmakers may be better positioned. Since electric vehicles are a relatively new business for all players, Chinese manufacturers and international rivals are largely starting from the same point.
“There is a smaller gap between where China is today and the rest of the world” in electric cars, said Bill Russo, managing director at Gao Feng Advisory, a Shanghai consultancy, and a former Chrysler executive. “There is room for newer start-up companies to dream big in China.”
Mr. Lu is one of those dreamers.
Fascinated by cars since he was a boy, he studied automotive engineering at Beijing’s prestigious Tsinghua University. Upon graduating in 1990, he joined the research and development team at the China-based joint venture of Jeep, then a division of Chrysler.
During his time there, which included two years in Detroit, Mr. Lu came to feel such overseas operations had limited prospects in China — the ventures’ partners would try to balance their interests, and so were slow to develop strategies and make decisions.
So in 2003, he and nine colleagues started CH-Auto Technology Corporation as a specialty research and design shop for the local car industry. Since then, the firm has designed vehicles for some of China’s biggest automakers.
Mr. Lu decided to start manufacturing his own vehicles because of the shift to electric. Since producing electric cars requires new parts and technologies, he believed a small entrant could better compete with these new vehicles than traditional automakers.
“Electric vehicles won’t just replace cars with conventional engines, but they will bring a huge change to the entire car industry,” Mr. Lu said. “We wanted to be part of this revolution.”
The result is the K50. Designed at his research center, the two-seater has a light, carbon fiber exterior and a console stuffed with touch screens. Rows of batteries propel the roadster to a top speed of about 120 miles per hour and carry it as far as 200 miles on a single charge.
No longer content to watch others produce his designs, Mr. Lu is currently constructing a $300 million factory in Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, to manufacture 50,000 cars a year. In all, he expects to invest as much as $1.4 billion into his venture over five years.
He did not specify what the car would sell for, but Mr. Lu intends to price the K50 at the top of the market when it goes on sale this year.
That sets CH-Auto on a collision course with the industry’s flagship: 
.
Elon Musk’s company already has an edge. While Mr. Lu is building his business from scratch, Tesla has been established in China since 2013. CH-Auto will have to persuade wealthy customers to plunk down a large sum on an unfamiliar brand — Qiantu — over Mr. Musk’s recognizable models.
Mr. Lu nevertheless remains confident. He argues the sporty K50 will appeal to a more leisure-oriented driver than Tesla’s cars. As a logo, the company has chosen the dragonfly, because its managers believe the speedy, nimble insect has similar attributes to his electric car. To market it, Mr. Lu is considering opening showrooms in major Chinese cities, backed by a platform to sell online.
Elon Musk “is someone I can learn from,” he said. “Tesla has huge symbolic significance because it is the first company to make people believe a business model solely around electric vehicles is possible.”
But, he added, “we are not looking to create the Chinese Tesla.”
When it comes to competing with Tesla, Mr. Lu can count on ample help from the Chinese government.
To bring down costs and spur demand, the state has unleashed a torrent of cash. It has offered subsidies to manufacturers and tax breaks for buyers, and plowed investments into charging stations to make electric cars more practical.
In all, UBS Securities estimates that the government spent $13 billion promoting electric vehicles in 2015 alone. So far, Mr. Lu has financed the K50 through loans and injections of fresh capital, but says he “won’t refuse” government subsidies if they become available.
Some analysts fear the state’s largess could prove as much bane as boon.
China may be recreating the waste and excess in electric cars that has plagued other state-targeted sectors, like steel and renewable energy, without spurring the technological innovation the economy needs to compete. And even though China’s car market is the world’s biggest, it is still unlikely to absorb all of the electric vehicle projects underway today.
“They are fueling overcapacity, with a lot of wasted money, and I’m doubtful that in the end you’ll have a successful electric car industry,” says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley who studies China’s auto industry policies.
Significant sums have already been squandered. In September, the Finance Ministry fined five companies for defrauding the government of $150 million by fabricating sales of electric vehicles to obtain more subsidies, and several companies have failed to make an impression.
Mr. Lu is certain, however, that the K50 stands out in a crowded field. The car has already gotten some advance buzz; a review on one popular Chinese website praised its design as “beautiful” and “avant-garde” and its body as “very muscular.”
“A big advantage they have is their knowledge of what it takes to build a quality vehicle,” said Jack Perkowski, managing partner of the Beijing-based consulting firm JFP Holdings and a veteran of China’s car sector. “They have a better chance than many others because of that.”
Mr. Lu is counting on it.
“There are a lot of electric vehicle companies and hot projects attracting a lot of money,” he said. “Not every company and not every car will be successful.”",China’s Answer to Tesla Is Hopeful Entrant to Global Car Market,"JAN. 26, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/automobiles/wheels/chinas-answer-to-tesla-is-hopeful-entrant-to-global-car-market.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MICHAEL SCHUMAN

Once upon a time, as one version of Chinese folklore goes, 12 animals competed in a big race across a river.
The rat jumped on the back of the kindhearted ox, who saw no problem giving the little guy a lift from one riverbank to the other. But as they neared the finish line — ahead of the others — the rat jumped off the ox and snatched first place. The ox came in a close second.
The Year of the Rat is, then, the first on the Chinese zodiac calendar, followed by the Year of the Ox, and so forth, based on the order in which the creatures finished the race.

China has reported over 225 human cases since September, 
. The nation’s Lunar New Year vacation starts soon, and as it does, live poultry shipments increase, and holiday travelers often spread the flu.
The fatality rate is not yet known, because some victims are still hospitalized. But Dr. Margaret Chan, the health organization’s director general, 
 that China had had more than 1,000 cases in the last four years, of which 39 percent were fatal.
“All countries must detect and report human cases promptly,” she said. “We cannot afford to miss the early signals.”
The flu typically infects people who raise, sell, slaughter or cook poultry, but human-to-human transmission is suspected in two cases that worry health officials. Both were older men with a history of poultry contact. One apparently infected a daughter who cared for him, and the other his hospital roommate.

 traveling to mainland China to avoid live poultry markets. More than 9 percent of samples from markets in nearby Guangdong Province contained H7N9 virus, a “substantial” reading, the department said.
Swabs are typically taken in cages, sewage gutters, feeding troughs, and chopping and de-feathering machines.
Since November, 
 in poultry flocks or in captured or dead wild birds. They include a new H5N6 strain, H5N8 and H5N5.
There have also been sporadic cases of H5N1, a strain with a 60 percent fatality rate that caused great alarm more than a decade ago. It has caused almost 400 confirmed deaths since 2003, but has not evolved the ability to transmit easily between people.
Since the highly contagious but relatively mild H1N1 “
” circled the globe in 2009, “the world is better prepared for the next influenza pandemic,” Dr. Chan said, “but not at all well enough.”",W.H.O.

"BEIJING — Xu Zhengming was lugging a 36-inch flat-screen television through the Beijing West Railway Station on his way home for 
’s Lunar New Year. Another passenger was hauling a tub of meat. And many migrant workers returning to their home villages carried bundles of clothes and gifts for children they see maybe once a year.
They all said that they could not go home empty-handed for China’s biggest holiday. Even if that meant carting a television for two days across 1,000 miles.
“I get to go back just once a year. It’s a long way,” Mr. Xu said as he heaved the television, bundled in protective clothing, through the railway station. He was headed to a village outside Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, a journey he estimated would take about 20 hours.
“My father is in the countryside, and the family is hard up,” said Mr. Xu, a middle-aged construction laborer in Beijing, the Chinese capital. “He always wanted a flat-screen television, so I’m taking mine home to give him.”
He and most other passengers at this cavernous, thrumming station were among hundreds of millions of Chinese on the move for the Lunar New Year. Many wore red hats or scarves, the color of good luck. While the total number of holiday travelers is hard to pin down, this is the world’s largest annual migration.
Zhang Kemin, a restaurant worker dragging a plastic tub holding about 18 pounds of beef and lamb, said he was taking the meat home to Hebei Province, adjacent to Beijing, to make boiled dumplings filled with a mix of meat and vegetables, an essential part of the holiday food in northern China.
“There’s pork at home,” he explained.
In the days before the holiday, big cities, like Beijing, and the coastal industrial regions exhale tens of millions of workers who head back to their hometowns and villages by train, plane, bus, car and motorbike for this family holiday of marathon eating, fireworks and paying respects to relatives. This year, the festivities start on Friday evening, when the country says goodbye to the Year of the Monkey and welcomes the Year of the Rooster.
On Thursday, the Beijing West Railway Station hummed like a giant boot camp, with the police, paramilitary troops and station staff members hustling passengers into waiting rooms to be corralled onto trains. Workers at the station said the holiday rush was more orderly than a decade ago, when heaving crowds threatened to overwhelm stations.
“It used to be crazy, but it’s a lot better now,” said Yang Guibao, a bald 64-year-old cleaner at the station. “They add many more trains for the Spring Festival, and the passengers don’t have to be so packed,” he said, using another name for the Lunar New Year.
With a wag of his finger, he warned, “There are still pickpockets around, but there are also plainclothes cops.”
China’s trains have become more numerous and faster than even a few years ago. More people go by car or plane, and they are not as bent on all going home at the same time. Some visit at quieter times of the year. China’s expanding 
 network now covers 
 of track. The railway administration has cracked down on ticket scalpers, and it has become common to order tickets online or from vending machines.
So while the holiday migration is still daunting, it’s not as crazy as before.
“Before it took a day on a train, but now it takes three and a half hours,” said Zhang Guiping, a 62-year-old businesswoman waiting for a train to Fuping, a county in Hebei Province. She said she had been in Beijing petitioning the government over a land dispute. Despite her feud with officialdom, she said she was happy with the better trains.
“There are more trains, the security checks take less time, and it’s easier to buy tickets,” she said.
The Chinese transportation authorities 
 that people will make close to three billion journeys over this Lunar New Year travel period, including 356 million trips by train. But those numbers can sound misleadingly large. Many people take multiple journeys — by train and bus — to get home and then return to work, so the actual number of bodies on the move is lower than those numbers may suggest.
That does not mean that the holiday rush is a tranquil experience.
The Beijing West Railway Station, in particular, is an unsightly monument to poor planning that opened in 1996, and its construction was 
. Officials estimated that in the 40-day holiday travel period that began in mid-January, the station would send off 11.8 million passengers, 6 percent more than last year, Chinese state radio 
.
People must steel themselves for big crowds, and then they scramble to jump on trains and find space for the gifts and treats that many take home. The official Lunar New Year break lasts a week, but the traditional festival ends after its 15th day. Many migrant workers from the countryside linger at home for precious time with children and parents, whom they rarely or never see the rest of the year.
But Wang Tianchang, a 32-year-old migrant laborer who had been sleeping on a sack of bedding in a train station waiting room, said he was not taking home any gifts for his children. His boss on a building site had not paid him $150 owed in wages.
“Things are expensive here. I haven’t bought a thing,” he said. But he said, “It’s really important to go home for the Spring Festival. You can see your wife and kids.”",Chinese New Year: Inside the World’s Largest Trek,"JAN. 26, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/world/asia/chinese-new-year-home-lunar.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,CHRIS BUCKLEY
"About 540 million years ago, our ancestors were insignificant creatures no more than a millimeter in size. They wriggled around in the sediments of shallow seas, gulped prey into their minuscule, baglike bodies and expelled the water through cone-shaped spouts around their mouths.
Animals this small do not fossilize well, which is why this stage of the distant evolutionary past is so little known. A cache of 45 individuals has now been unearthed in Shaanxi Province, in central China. They are described in the Monday issue of the 
 by a team led by Jian Han of Northwest University in Xi’an, China.
The creatures are the oldest known members of an ancient group called deuterostomes, said Simon Conway Morris, a paleontologist at Cambridge University in England and a member of the team. Deuterostomes, which lie pretty close to the base of the family tree of all animals, are ancestral not just to humans but to a wide array of animals ranging from sea urchins and starfish to the vast family of vertebrates.
The deuterostomes, a name that means “mouth second” in Greek, were so called by anatomists to distinguish them from the protostomes, or “mouth firsters,” the other members of a vast group of animals with bilateral symmetry. In the early embryo — a sphere of cells formed shortly after the egg is fertilized — the protostomes form the mouth first, anus second. The deuterostomes do it the other way round.
But strangely, the new deuterostome fossils seem to have no anus, presumably using the mouth for evacuation. At least the researchers cannot see one. “Our material is generally crushed, and despite the superb preservation we might have overlooked the evidence,” Dr. Conway Morris said.
The fossils were found in rock strata, stated to be some 540 million years old in a news release issued by St. John’s College, Cambridge, of which Dr. Conway Morris is a fellow. The release describes the fossils as “the earliest known prehistoric ancestor of humans,” referring to their status as the earliest known deuterostomes. Although slightly older animal fossils are known, they lie on branches of the tree of life that do not lead to humans.",This Prehistoric Human Ancestor Was All Mouth,"JAN. 30, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/science/this-prehistoric-human-ancestor-was-all-mouth.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,NICHOLAS WADE

"HONG KONG — A Chinese-born billionaire who has forged financial ties with some of the country’s most powerful families was taken by the Chinese police from his apartment at the Four Seasons Hotel in 
 late last week and spirited across the border, a person close to the businessman said on Tuesday.
The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, who has been missing since Friday, is in police custody in 
, where he apparently is safe, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of arrest. Mr. Xiao is a Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport, though he was born in China.
His removal from Hong Kong appears to contravene the “one country, two systems” rule that allows the former British colony to run its own affairs and bars the Chinese police from operating here.
When asked on Tuesday about Mr. Xiao, the Hong Kong police issued a statement saying that “the subject” had entered mainland China through a border crossing on Friday. His disappearance was reported the following day, but on Sunday one of Mr. Xiao’s family members reported that Mr. Xiao was safe and that the family had asked to withdraw the missing person’s filing.
Mr. Xiao, 45, had spent years outside China, most recently staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong.
The situation is eerily reminiscent of the case of another foreign-passport holder, the bookseller Lee Bo, who disappeared off the streets of Hong Kong in late 2015, only to turn up days later in Chinese custody. His case, as well as the disappearance of four of his business associates, made 
 and shook many people in Hong Kong, who saw his abduction as a violation of the city state’s ability to run its own affairs, guaranteed by international treaty until 2047.
Mr. Xiao, a prodigy who passed the examination to enter the elite Peking University at age 14, controls a sprawling empire with shares in banks, insurance companies, coal, cement and property through his Tomorrow Group. The 
, which tracks Chinese billionaires, estimated his fortune last year at 40 billion renminbi, or $5.8 billion. But that vastly understates his wealth, said the person close to Mr. Xiao.
Mr. Xiao’s fortunes rose after his graduation from the university in 1990, where he had been head of the official student organization and stayed loyal to the government during the pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.
In recent years, Mr. Xiao has acted as a kind of banker to the ruling class, paying $2.4 million in 2013 to buy shares in an investment firm held by the sister and brother-in-law of China’s president, Xi Jinping. A company he helped to control financed a deal that benefited the son-in-law of a top former leader, Jia Qinglin, 
 in 2014.
Mr. Xiao bought the shares from Mr. Xi’s relatives to 
 financial holdings following a 
 by Bloomberg News that detailed his relatives’ wealth. He did it “for the family,” Mr. Xiao’s spokeswoman said in 2014.
His fate in recent days has been the 
 and confusion in Hong Kong and in the overseas Chinese-language press after reports emerged that he had been arrested. On Tuesday, Mr. Xiao posted two notices on his company’s WeChat account saying he had not been taken from Hong Kong to the mainland and instead was “recuperating abroad” and soon would meet with media organizations.
In Chinese, there is no ambiguity: “Abroad” means outside the mainland. Those posts have since been removed. Those statements were untrue, according to the person close to Mr. Xiao, and were meant to tamp down interest in the story, because China’s government did not want it publicized.
The person did not know why Mr. Xiao had been taken to the mainland, adding that his relatives, including his wife and son, were not in China. The Tomorrow Group has extensive holdings in China. Previous disappearances of Chinese billionaires have generated turmoil in Chinese stock markets, which are closed this week for the Lunar New Year.
On Tuesday evening, the Hong Kong police press office would not comment on whether the local police had helped arrest Mr. Xiao and transport him across the border, and it would not say whether the Chinese police had illegally apprehended Mr. Xiao, saying only that it had asked the mainland police for help in the case.
The Chinese Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request seeking comment on Mr. Xiao.

"JINGDEZHEN, China — For centuries, the most coveted china from China came out of Jingdezhen’s workshops — fashioned from clay made smooth by trained hands, fired in kilns and then transported across the world.
The works graced the courts of the Persians, Mongols and French. Some craved blue-and-white vases. Others admired jade-green celadon bowls. This was China’s greatest export, the rival of silk.
The fall of the Qing dynasty and war and revolutions in the 20th century broke the artisan culture, unless one counts Communist statues as an important stage in China’s hallowed porcelain tradition.
Now that tradition is being revived at the roots. Young people are moving to study in Jingdezhen, a river town in the southern Chinese province of Jiangxi. Studios and workshops have popped up around town and in the surrounding valleys. Some of the new artisans hope to profit from their skills, since the country’s middle-class boom of recent decades has meant a greater demand for porcelain.
“I like the atmosphere here very much,” said Fang Xin, 27, a woman from the Guangxi region who showed me how she was sculpting a clay cup with her hands one morning in a former factory. “A lot of people with dreams come here. There is a variety of teachers, and they teach all kinds of skills and ideas.”
There is even a term for young artists like Ms. Fang: jingpiao, or Jingdezhen drifters.
Ms. Fang was working in a space managed by the 
, an education center opened in 2005 by the sculptors 
 and Takeshi Yasuda that has become a magnet for jingpiao. (The workshop’s mother branch opened in Hong Kong in 1985.) The center has been critical in rejuvenating the Jingdezhen ceramics scene.
In 2008, Ms. Cheng opened a Saturday outdoor market in a courtyard space by the workshop and its cafe, so artists could try to make a living by selling their creations.
The idea came when a recent workshop graduate asked Ms. Cheng if she could sell items outside the cafe. She wanted to set up on a blanket, but Ms. Cheng insisted on erecting a proper tent covering, said Po-Wen Liu, the workshop’s deputy director and a teacher there. These days, about 80 artists take part in the market. They place their wares on tables under white awnings.
Mr. Liu is from Taiwan and studied ceramics art there and in the United States before teaching at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He joined the Pottery Workshop in December 2015 after answering an ad for a teaching position. His wife, son and daughter continue to live in Greensboro.
“Since I was a student, I wanted to come to Jingdezhen,” he said. “It’s the mecca.”
Mr. Liu teaches classes of about 15 students for one week or more. These take place in a building at the rear gate of the compound, which is on the grounds of a state-run sculpture factory. Two brick chimneys from an unused kiln rise near the education center. Many students are recent graduates of the 
, the most prominent academy in town.
“I would say their craftsmanship is amazing and their technical level is very high,” Mr. Liu said. “But their conceptual skills need improvement. There’s too much historical burden. They need to break out of the boundaries.”
“For example, if I ask them to make a cup, they will make something very uniform,” he added. “They might have an idea of what a Chinese cup looked like 1,000 years ago. They will stick with this. I personally like more creativity. I tell them to have the work reflect the handmade quality, not something made by machine.”
Though most students are Chinese, the workshop has an international flavor. The manager is Siumei Ngan, a trained arts administrator who moved here from Hong Kong in November 2015. At any given time, the workshop has about eight artists in residence, most of them from outside China. They stay up to six months.
There are also foreign study groups. In the cafe, I met Brandon Schnur, 29, the co-leader of a group of 13 students from the West Virginia University Ceramics Program visiting for the summer.
The workshop has a pottery kiln that resident artists can use. They work in individual studios on the upper floor of one building. Sunlight streams in from large glass windows.
A Canadian woman, Denise White, 29, sat at a table painting a small porcelain outdoor scene with snow-covered trees and a polar bear. She said her goal for the two-and-a-half-week residency was to design molds of Canadian scenes that she could bring home to make sculptures for sale.
“I got 13 small molds made here,” Ms. White said. “The master mold-makers here can pretty much do anything.”
Jingdezhen has been producing ceramics since the early Chinese dynasties. But it was during the Tang dynasty, from 618 to 907, that word of the town’s arts spread.
In that era, Jingdezhen was called Changnan because it sits on the south bank of the Chang River, and some historians say the word “china” — and thus the Western name of the country — came from a bad transliteration of the town’s name. Some scholars date China’s earliest fine porcelain to the Five Dynasties and 10 Kingdoms period, a time of upheaval in the 10th century.
Dynasties rose and fell, but each new emperor ordered porcelain to be brought from Jingdezhen to their courts. Imperial officials were posted in Jingdezhen to oversee the production. Pieces from here carried a stamp of authenticity and gained prominence worldwide.
Today, the values of those works are among the highest in the Chinese art world. At a 2014 Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong, the Shanghai businessman Liu Yiqian offered 
 for a delicate Ming dynasty porcelain cup, called a “chicken cup,” that was fired in Jingdezhen’s imperial kilns.
After paying for the cup with a credit card, he took a celebratory sip of tea from it.
After the Communists took over in 1949, Jingdezhen became known for the production of propaganda statues. By 1958, that work was consolidated into 10 main factories or studios.
In recent years, the local government has begun its own efforts to rejuvenate the porcelain industry. But people in the industry say it is the small, privately run workshops that are revitalizing the traditions while injecting them with new ideas.
One such workshop lies in the Sanbao Village area across a river. Here, artists and businesspeople have opened workshops and studios throughout a lush valley.
Perhaps the most striking one is 
, whose sprawling showroom consists of four connected traditional homes moved here from the 
, in neighboring Anhui Province. Bowls, plates and vases sit on tables and are bathed in the soft glow of overhead lights. Buddhist figurines are also on display.
The porcelain works are designed by Jiang Bo, 35, a native of Xi’an who came to Jingdezhen in 2001 to study at the ceramics institute. Eight years later, he opened his own studio. More than 40 people work for it on the grounds here.
A signature piece is a small teapot with a pair of cups, all in a creamy powder blue. Each cup has a tiny rough nub on the smooth bottom, like a rock protruding from an ocean’s surface. Called “Mountain and Water,” the set sells for $150.
“If you want to develop a career around ceramics, Jingdezhen is the best place,” said Mr. Jiang, who is now vice general manager of the company.
Like the Pottery Workshop, Zhenrutang also has a residency program for foreign artists.
“More and more young people decide to stay here,” Mr. Jiang said. “Some of them come from big cities. Here, it’s easier to start ceramics workshops.”
But like the town’s pottery, some Jingdezhen drifters are now moving to other corners of China. Ms. Cheng, co-founder of the Pottery Workshop, said artists were getting married, having children and asking themselves what were more suitable environments for them. She lives in Dali, a rural town in Yunnan Province that has 
.
“I have now met a lot of people who have gone home,” Ms. Cheng said. “I really don’t encourage people to stay in Jingdezhen forever. It’s good that they go home. They can teach others what they’ve learned here.”",Ancient Porcelain Arts Thrive Again in a Chinese River Town,"JAN. 31, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/world/asia/china-ancient-porcelain-arts-jingdezhen.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,EDWARD WONG
"BEIJING — Zhang Heng barged through an exam-room door, surprising a doctor and a patient. He didn’t have time to knock. In Mr. Zhang’s business, every second counts.
“You have to hand it directly to the person,” said Mr. Zhang, one of the legions of package couriers in Beijing who help power China’s online shopping boom. He spoke as he blitzed through a surgical wing, medical storeroom and patient ward delivering parcels small and large, soft and square, to doctors and nurses in an effort to ensure the right person gets the right package.
“Otherwise,” Mr. Zhang said, “you may get fined.”
The Chinese e-commerce industry has been built on the backs of couriers — called kuaidi, or express delivery, in China — like Mr. Zhang. They number 1.2 million, by one survey, and online retailers like 
 use them to zip packages to customers by scooter or three-wheeled electric cart. Across China, the world’s largest market for package delivery, a courier shouting “kuaidi!” through a door or a phone signals your package has arrived.
But for the couriers — who are largely unskilled workers from China’s interior — the work can be low-paying and difficult. It is coming under scrutiny from labor activists and legal experts who say many couriers face punishing hours and harsh working conditions.
Nearly one-quarter of them work more than 12 hours a day, seven days a week, according to the survey, which covered 40,000 couriers and was conducted by Beijing Jiaotong University and Alibaba’s research and logistics arms. A majority work more than eight hours a day each day of the week.
Labor standards in the industry vary widely, but many couriers work under arrangements that might, for example, provide no overtime pay or no employer contributions to their government health care and pension benefits. Just as in the United States, where 
 and 
 work as contractors, those arrangements raise questions about what defines work and employment.
Couriers, meanwhile, complain about fines. Some delivery companies penalize them if they do not deliver all the morning’s packages by 2 p.m. Poor penmanship, damage to a package or customer complaints can also result in fines, which can add up to a week’s pay.
“I’m here to make money,” said Mr. Zhang, a 28-year-old former coal miner from Shanxi Province who is saving money to build a home, widely seen in the countryside as indispensable in attracting a wife. “If I’m not diligent now, I’m going to regret it. I’m almost 30 and still single.”
China hopes to move away from manufacturing and seeks to build a more service-oriented economy driven by accountants, lawyers and other professionals. Yet for migrant workers at the bottom of the pay scale, service work can mean conditions not unlike those in China’s factories, where lax enforcement has long led to excessive overtime and unsafe conditions.
Some couriers work directly for companies such as JD.com, an e-commerce retailer, or SF Express, a delivery service. Others drive for a group of delivery companies that dominate the business of ferrying packages on behalf of online retailers like Alibaba. One of those companies, ZTO Express, last year 
 in a share offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
Those companies run nationwide distribution networks but rely on smaller companies for last-mile delivery — and there the relationships can become murky. Those smaller companies, which are franchisees of the big delivery companies, sign up drivers as employees or contractors. Some of those drivers subcontract their work to other drivers.
Those arrangements often result in couriers who drive under the name of a big delivery company but whose hours and terms are only loosely managed, experts say. For example, many drivers lack workers’ compensation benefits or insurance in case of accidents, said Jin Yingjie, a professor specializing in labor law at the China University of Political Science and Law.
Delivery companies “should work to bring the industry into the confines of the labor law,” she said.
Meanwhile, tough conditions have led to unrest among couriers, said Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labor Bulletin, a workers’ rights group based in Hong Kong. His group has seen disputes in a number of Chinese cities, he said, along with a 
 as economic growth slows.
“The delivery companies are pushing drivers to the point of taking collective action,” Mr. Elmer said.
In December, a weeklong strike brought deliveries by one package company partly owned by Alibaba, YTO Express, to a halt in Baoji, a city in Shaanxi Province.
“Where’s our October pay?” one of the deliverymen told a local TV station. “There needs to be someone in charge handling this. There’s nobody.”
A spokeswoman for YTO Express said the strike was caused by a franchisee who did not promptly calculate fees or properly communicate with couriers.
“Alibaba is a leader in big data technology,” an Alibaba spokesman said in a statement. “Taking advantage of that strength, we are committed to helping the logistics industry improve its efficiency and the working conditions for couriers and other industry participants.”
Most couriers make about $300 to $600 a month, according to the Jiaotong study — an amount roughly equal to the wages of China’s migrant factory workers. They can deliver 150 packages on a weekday, drivers said, sometimes helped by making mass deliveries to office buildings.
Couriers generally make about 15 cents per package delivered, according to drivers and reports in the state news media, though they can make more by picking up outgoing packages from customers or through other tasks.
The work initially appealed to many as package volume boomed. But their pay per package has barely budged in recent years as competition intensified and more drivers entered the market. About 40 percent of couriers quit within a year, according to the Jiaotong study.
“Most deliverymen are like me,” said Lu Yong, who quit in December. “They work for three months and realize it’s no good.”
Mr. Lu, 29, of Henan Province, spent years assembling electronics in the southern province of Guangdong before going to work for a ZTO Express franchisee in Beijing. “The factories lack the same freedom as delivery, but it’s not cold like here,” he said. “And every month you get four days of rest, too.”
Mr. Lu’s November pay slip showed that he was paid $382 on 4,291 packages delivered, after fines and other expenses including his uniform. He says he pays for maintenance on his cart, which bears ZTO’s logo, including new tires, replacement batteries and new brakes. He also said he never signed a labor contract.
James Guo, the chief financial officer of ZTO Express, said that it required its franchisees to comply with local laws but that “it’s not up to us to manage or control the compensation of our deliverymen.”
Some thrive. Li Pengbo, 21, from Henan Province, drives for Best Express, another large delivery company in which Alibaba owns a stake. He dominates the area he subcontracted from a Best Express franchisee, he said, and earns about $2,000 a month.
“Since the sixth day of the last Chinese New Year until now I haven’t rested, not a single day,” Mr. Li said, describing an 11-month stretch. “I work from 6:30 in the morning until 11 or 12 p.m. at night.”
“My family is poor. This bitterness is nothing compared to what they’ve gone through,” he said.
A spokeswoman for Best Express said its franchisees were required to follow labor laws.
Franchisees say they have borne the brunt of declining delivery prices. “If we can turn a profit eight months of the year, that’s not bad,” said Wang Lin, a franchisee in Beijing for another delivery company, STO Express.
Ms. Wang said her franchise does not pay for driver benefits because the drivers are contractors, not employees.
“Frankly it’s not a very good job,” she said. “It’s extremely tiring, the salary is not high, and the responsibility and risks are great. We don’t have a stable work force.”","For Couriers, China’s E-Commerce Boom Can Be a Tough Road","JAN. 31, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/business/china-courier-delivery-labor.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,RYAN MCMORROW

"LONDON — America’s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends.
They have heard the mantra “America First” from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump’s denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will

“We’ve always said that America is our best friend,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup — comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency — said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. “If that’s no longer the case, if that’s what we need to understand from 
, then of course Europe will look for new friends.”
“China is a very strong candidate for that,” he added. “The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn’t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends.”
On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. “The two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,” a German government spokesman later said in a written statement.
The swift reassessment of trade relations — a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II — only amplifies the potential for a shake-up of the broader geopolitical framework.
Mr. Trump has already 
 as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by 
 from the president of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. 
 to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values.
Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail.
But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China’s growing influence.
Then, on Thursday, his administration 
 a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Peña Nieto of 
 canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall — resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war.
“I’m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,” said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “One would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that’s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly.”
The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the job-creating magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative.
Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table.
At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had “a very good call” with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico “has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,” he said. “I’m not going to let that happen.”
Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen.
Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7,000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Juárez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries.
Mr. Trump’s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell’s work force. “They hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,” he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But in the end, he said, business will carry on.
“In 31 years, I’ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,” he said. “We’ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way.”
Most experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump’s trade posture. Given that nearly one-third of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage.
The three countries are intertwined in the 
. China makes components that go into auto parts manufactured in the United States. Those parts are delivered to factories in Mexico that produce finished vehicles sold to Americans. Calling such vehicles Mexican imports misses that much of the value is produced in the United States, employing American labor.
“The idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a 19th-century or early 20th-century conception of trade,” said Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. “You don’t even know who you’re going to hurt with these kind of things. You’re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end.”
Mr. Trump owes his office in no small measure to factory workers who have come to 
 to their livelihoods. But their sentiments are grounded not in ideology, but in a desire for jobs at decent wages. If Mr. Trump impedes imports, he could put some of these voters out of work.
Beyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump’s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments.
In emphasizing “America First,” Mr. Trump has generated a widespread sense that the country is surrendering its global leadership position. 
 of the European Union has enhanced the view that a period of international integration has devolved to a new era in which nationalist concerns are paramount.
On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe.
“Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union’s bureaucracy. “Getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough.”
With both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision.
China is working to assume the mantle. President Xi Jinping of China last week used 
 in Davos, to submit his nation’s bid as a reliable champion of expanded trade.
China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on state-owned enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi’s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike.
At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi’s address, a Berlin-based 
 fund manager, André Loesekrug-Pietri, stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era.

"Every day, the president’s behavior becomes more worrying. One day he demeans a federal judge who challenges him; the next day, without evidence, he accuses the media of hiding illegal voting or acts of terrorism. His lack of respect for institutions and truth pours out so fast, you start to forget how crazy this behavior is for any adult, let alone a president, and just how ugly things will get when we have a real crisis. And crises are baked into this story because of the incoherence of President Trump’s worldview.
How so? The world today is more interdependent than ever. The globalization of markets, the spread of cellphones, the accelerations in technology and biology, the new mass movements of migrants and the disruptions in the climate are all intertwined and impacting one another. As a result, we need a president who can connect all of these dots and navigate a path that gets the most out of them and cushions the worst.
But Trump is a dot exploiter, not connector. He made a series of reckless, unconnected promises, not much longer than tweets, to get elected, and now he’s just checking off each one, without thinking through the linkages among them or anticipating second-order effects.
It is a great way to make America weak — and overstretched — again.
Where do I start? Trump wants to get tougher with 
 on trade and security. That’s not crazy. But how would I do that? I’d organize an alliance of Pacific trading nations that surround China and enlist them in a trade pact that supports U.S.-style rule of law, greater market access for U.S. intellectual property and products and promotes U.S. values — as opposed to China’s. I’d call it the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP for short.
Oh wait, President Barack Obama did that, but Trump scrapped TPP on Day 1, without, I am sure, having read it. Now there is every reason to believe our Asian-Pacific allies will fall even more under China’s economic sway and trade “rules.” How smart is that?
And by the way, why is labor in 
 cheaper than in America? One reason is that Mexico has weaker labor rights and environmental standards. Let’s see … what would TPP require of Mexico and other signatories? 
Instead, Trump is building a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants and force companies to move to the U.S. Let’s see … what happened after 9/11, when the border crossings with Mexico and Canada were severely constricted for security? It forced some assembly line shutdowns at U.S. auto companies, like Ford, because their supply chains stretched to Mexico and Canada. The lower-cost work is done in Mexico and then integrated with higher-value-added work in America, which enables our car companies to compete on price in Europe, Japan and China.
So what did the U.S., Canada and Mexico do after 9/11? They created a North American security envelope, explained Seth Stodder, Obama’s assistant secretary of homeland security, so if you fly into Mexico or Toronto from the Middle East, our Homeland Security Department now probably knows about it.
“Since 9/11, we and our Mexican and Canadian partners have worked to secure the North American perimeter by sharing information on people and goods coming to our countries, cross-referencing that information against terrorism databases and working collaboratively to identify potential bad actors trying to come to North America,” Stodder said. If we build a wall and demand that Mexico pay for it, how long will it go on cooperating with us?
And if Trump forces all these U.S.-based multinationals to move operations from Mexico back to the U.S., what will that do? Help tank the Mexican economy so more Mexicans will try to come north, and raise the costs for U.S. manufacturers. What will they do? Move their factories to the U.S. but replace as many humans as possible with robots to contain costs.
The U.N. says there’s a record 65 million displaced migrants and refugees, mostly from the developing world, trying to get into secure places like the U.S. or Europe. Why? A mix of civil wars, state failures, climate stresses and population explosions. What did Trump do his first week? Appoint climate deniers to key posts and ban U.S. aid to health groups that provide abortion as a family-planning option in developing nations.
Trump wants to partner with 
 to defeat 
 in 
 — a worthy goal. But Putin hasn’t been trying to defeat ISIS. He’s been trying to defeat democracy in Syria to keep the genocidal pro-Russian dictator there in power.
Will that be our goal, too? And who are Putin’s allies in Syria? Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite mercenaries from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will they be our allies, too? No. We will enlist Iraqi and Syrian Sunnis to help us, says Trump. Really? But he just barred them from entering the U.S. How cooperative will they be?
And whom else might this ban keep out? Remember Steve Jobs? His biological father was Abdulfattah “John” Jandali. He came to America as a student in the 1950s and studied at the University of Wisconsin. He was from … Homs, Syria.

"WASHINGTON — A secretive Chinese company with deep ties to the country’s Communist Party has become one of the biggest foreign investors in the United States over the past year, snapping up American firms in a string of multibillion-dollar deals. But it is one of its smaller deals that is apparently stalling the White House career of a top adviser to President Trump.
Anthony Scaramucci, a flamboyant former campaign fund-raiser for Mr. Trump whom the president has appointed as the White House liaison to the business community, has been in limbo for more than a week since he agreed to sell his investment firm to a subsidiary of the Chinese conglomerate, HNA Group.
Mr. Scaramucci is on the job but has yet to be sworn in, partly because of concerns about the Jan. 17 deal, according to two administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters.
It is the second time a politically connected Chinese company has chased a business deal with an incoming White House official. And it is evidence of the unusual confluence of interests between superrich members of the new Trump administration who need to unwind complex financial portfolios to comply with government rules and international firms eager to buy American assets.
“You are not going to get an administration with thousands of political appointees and not have people who have contacts with the Chinese,” said Derek Scissors, a 
 specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning research organization in Washington.
Still, he said, no one should have any illusions about the Chinese motivation behind such deals. “HNA is looking for influence in an administration that looks like it is positioning itself to be anti-China,” he said. “They all are.”
Previous administrations have rarely faced such issues, partly because the surge of Chinese investment in the United States is relatively recent. Chinese companies are on a buying spree, 
 in American companies and projects last year alone. HNA Group, a conglomerate focused heavily on aviation, burst onto the American business scene last year when it bought a quarter of the hotelier Hilton Worldwide Holdings for $6.5 billion, and 
 for the information technology giant Ingram Micro.
Last year, Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese financial colossus, 
 in a Manhattan office tower owned by the family business of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Kushner, 36, is now one of the president’s most influential advisers, with a White House portfolio that is expected to include handling America’s relationship with China. Mr. Trump has taken a hawkish stance toward China, threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese imports, and demanding that China abandon the artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea in an attempt to bolster its claim to the vast area.
Compared to Mr. Kushner, who still has some ties to his family’s real estate empire, Mr. Scaramucci appears to be making a clean break from his business, SkyBridge Capital. Although the sale price could rise as high as $230 million, depending on the company’s future performance, Mr. Scaramucci’s payment is fixed, he said in an interview on Monday.
HNA is a newcomer to the asset management field in the United States, and companies like SkyBridge — so-called funds of funds that act essentially as middlemen investing clients’ money in hedge funds — have experienced pain in recent years. Citing high fees and disappointing performance, investors have withdrawn billions from such firms. SkyBridge’s asset pool has shrunk by more than $2 billion since mid-2015, and its flagship fund posted its second straight year of negative returns in 2016.
While Mr. Kushner’s negotiations with Anbang apparently raised few eyebrows in Mr. Trump’s inner circle, some White House officials appear to view Mr. Scaramucci’s sale of his firm to HNA with more suspicion. Mr. Scaramucci was left out of the group of about two dozen White House aides who were sworn in on Jan. 22.
One White House official cited concerns that it could take as long as three months for the SkyBridge deal to close and be approved by the ethics office. Mr. Scaramucci’s lawyer said this period of time was standard for any large, complex deal.
A White House spokesman did not comment on Mr. Scaramucci’s status.
Allies of Mr. Scaramucci’s said the sale of his company was a red herring, and attributed the delay in his swearing-in to objections from Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who they said had not favored giving Mr. Scaramucci a White House position. Mr. Priebus’s allies denied that.
In an interview, Mr. Scaramucci rejected any notion that HNA was seeking a friend in the administration, saying that his company was a highly attractive investment and that HNA was a logical buyer. HNA has described the purchase as an important toehold in the American market for its growing asset management businesses.
Even if HNA was hoping for influence, Mr. Scaramucci said, he has walled himself off from any discussions with the Chinese company. David Boies, his lawyer, said Mr. Scaramucci went well beyond what was required to rule out any perception of a conflict of interest.
“They know they cannot talk to me, so what influence are they buying?” Mr. Scaramucci said in the interview. “If people are saying that HNA is trying to buy access, then people are saying HNA is stupid.”
“I took their bid because it would protect my clients, partners and investors,” he said. “So what did I do wrong?”
An irrepressible self-described “diva” nicknamed “the Mooch,” Mr. Scaramucci, 53, is as outspoken as HNA’s owners are tight-lipped. His support for Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries came late, and only after he initially attacked Mr. Trump as a “hack politician” with “a big mouth.” He first backed Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, and then Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor.
Still, he was one of the first Wall Street financiers to sign up with Mr. Trump’s campaign, and has been a relentless cheerleader for him since May, using the blunt, colorful speech that made him a frequent news show guest. At a national business conference sponsored by SkyBridge in May, Mr. Scaramucci said that Mr. Trump was only “saying cuckoo-la-la things” because he knows that “the red-meat-eating Middle American loves the swipes at the know-it-alls.”
Analysts of Chinese politics and strategy say the ties between administration officials and companies like Anbang and HNA bear careful watching, because while such firms are ostensibly privately owned, their very survival depends on the good will of the Chinese government.
“They will do, and they have time and time again done, many, many things at the behest of the Chinese government,” said Victor Shih, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego who specializes in the nexus between business and politics in China.
And few private companies have as obvious ties to the Chinese government as HNA, whose connections rival even those of Anbang, whose chairman married the granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, China’s former paramount leader.
Faxes and emails sent to HNA press offices in Beijing and in Hainan were not responded to, and phone calls were not answered. A company spokesman in the United States declined to comment for the record.
Chen Feng, the firm’s chairman and founder, has the Chinese political titles that are the equivalent of a peerage or knighthood. He has been a delegate since 2002 to the high-level 
 held every five years that pick the country’s leadership, a streak almost no other private company executive can match.
While HNA’s ownership structure is murky, it has paired with a company run by the son of a former member of the party’s top ruling body, the Politburo Standing Committee. In 2008, HNA formed a venture in the northern city Tianjin with Womei Investment Management, part of a group of firms led by a son of He Guoqiang, then the Communist Party’s powerful discipline chief, Chinese corporate records show.
With more than $90 billion in assets, HNA has been showered with cheap loans that have helped fuel its overseas purchases. The amounts are extraordinary for a private company.
HNA Group’s biggest lenders are two government policy banks, followed by a gaggle of state-owned commercial banks that as of the end of 2015 gave HNA a combined $67.4 billion line of credit, according to a bond prospectus.
One major shareholder, Guan Jun, who records show may indirectly own more than a quarter of the company, lists his address in a rundown apartment block in Beijing. In the filthy hallway outside his door, a decaying bed lies upright, a bag of trash suspended from its frame.
Some in Mr. Trump’s inner circle argued that Mr. Scaramucci’s skills as a salesman made him the perfect fit to head the White House Office of Public Liaison. Mr. Scaramucci said he was so eager to serve his government that he took the job for $1 a year and gave up a “phenomenal” company.
Mr. Scaramucci, who had a controlling interest in the firm, said three other entities bid for SkyBridge besides HNA, including one that offered him more money but would have laid off 40 employees. HNA, which teamed up with a second firm to buy the company, will become its majority owner.
Whether selling his firm to join the White House will prove a wise move still seems uncertain. “Why are people so stupid to blow up their lives to serve the country they love?” Mr. Scaramucci said in the interview on Monday.

"America’s rivals and enemies have enjoyed a very good 10 days.
One clear beneficiary has been ISIS, which has spent years trying to persuade Muslims that the United States is at war with Islam. ISIS wants to eliminate the world’s 
 the places where Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Jews live in harmony.
No wonder that ISIS-affiliated social media gleefully posted President Trump’s executive order this weekend, as 
 of The Times 
. Trump’s call for a Muslim ban, like his unsubtle attempt to implement one, plays right into ISIS’ desire to eliminate the gray zone. The president of the United States himself now seems to agree that Muslims and non-Muslims can’t live together.
Besides the 
 and apparent 
 of Trump’s order, it’s worth weighing the strategic effects as well. Yes, it is conceivable that barring visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would keep out a future terrorist. But it’s highly unlikely.
They are already intensely vetted, and previous attackers have generally come from other countries. “The end result of this ban will not be a drop in terror attacks,” as dozens of American diplomats wrote, in 
 that leaked. Instead, “it will be a drop in international good will towards Americans and” — because of the chilling effect on travel — “a threat towards our economy.”
So any strategic benefits are tiny while the costs are substantial: Trump has just helped ISIS recruiters. He has angered Iraq, France and others battling ISIS. He’s started a new argument in the Middle East, which long distracted the United States. Most alarmingly, he has undercut our claim to stand for larger principles — freedom, rule of law, even basic competence.
This undermining of both American values and interests has been an early theme of the administration. And the ultimate beneficiary is not likely to be ISIS. Although it poses serious threats, it is not a serious rival to the United States. The ultimate beneficiary is instead likely to be America’s biggest global rival: China.
China remains far less powerful than the United States. But it has come a long way. Its economic progress and its ambitions, combined with the size of its population, mean that China has become the world’s only other potential superpower.
Some degree of a rising China is inevitable — and welcome, given the continued reduction in poverty that will happen. The big unknown is whether China will change as it rises, to become freer and more respectful of the rule of law, or whether China will mold the rest of the world in 
.
Here, too, the Trump administration has set back American interests.
In another executive order, Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Whatever you think about the deal’s economic effects (and there has been a lot of 
 on both the left and the right), they were likely to be 
. The United States already has few barriers to Asian imports, which is why some combination of your car, television, computer, phone and clothing comes from Asia.
The pact was more about geopolitics than economics. It was, as the Australian academic Salvatore Babones 
 in Foreign Affairs, “primarily a tool for spreading U.S. interests abroad.” Much of the Pacific Rim, including Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia, welcomed it, too.
They welcomed it because they want a strong American presence to offset Chinese power in Asia. These countries have close commercial ties with China, but they are afraid of becoming merely moons that orbit Beijing. They tend to prefer the American model to the Chinese model.
That’s why they were willing to adopt American-style rules on intellectual property, pollution and labor unions, even though those rules created some political tensions in those countries.
Now that Trump has rejected our would-be Asian allies, China is trying to put together a different trade pact with some of the same countries. If China succeeds, it will gain more sway in Asia, as will a more bare-knuckle economic system in which copyrights, worker rights, product safety and the environment aren’t taken very seriously.
Meanwhile, Beijing will be able to point to Trump’s extralegal stances as proof that the United States is just another self-interested, transactional nation. After all, the United States also threatened a trade war when it was unhappy with one of its neighbors and also mistreats its ethnic minorities.
The early pattern of Trump foreign policy is to take actions that have the veneer of strength but are actually weak. It’s a kind of anti-Teddy Rooseveltism. Instead of speaking softly and carrying a big stick, the White House is screaming loudly to hide insecurity about the strength of its stick.
The people with the most ability to limit the damage are Republicans who see themselves as advocates of a strong America. Bob Corker, John McCain, Marco Rubio and other members of Congress have enough leverage over the administration, 
, to influence it.
The question they should be asking themselves is: How do our enemies and rivals feel about the Trump administration so far?",Make China Great Again,"JAN. 31, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/make-china-great-again.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,
"John Mearsheimer, a noted political scientist at the University of Chicago, has long believed that 
’s rise will not be peaceful. Tensions with the United States will simmer as the Asian giant expands its influence.
“Containment is an alternative to war against a rising China,” Professor Mearsheimer proposed in 
 “The Tragedy of Great Power Politics.” “Nevertheless, war is always a possibility.”
On Nov. 8, the odds of war with China got shorter.
From his provocative phone call with Taiwan’s president that infuriated Beijing — which considers Taiwan a rogue, breakaway province — to his heated claims that China steals American jobs, President Trump “seems to be pursuing policies that raise the risk of an actual shooting war,” Mr. Mearsheimer said.
By promising to raise a 
 of tariffs against imports from China, Mr. Trump seems set to undercut the one solid counterargument used over the years against the professor’s grim outlook: that the United States and China would become too economically interdependent to risk a conflagration.
War would be a uniquely bad idea. China, after all, has nuclear weapons. But perhaps what troubles the professor most is that Mr. Trump’s stand seems pointless. “One can justify provocative moves if they serve an important strategic goal,” Mr. Mearsheimer told me. “It is not clear what purpose these moves are designed to serve.”
And yet pointlessness is coming to define American foreign policy. Mr. Trump lacks an end game.
Security experts in the United States are baffled by Mr. Trump’s executive order abruptly barring entry by citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries, noting that it will ultimately put the security of the United States at risk by sending a uniform message of hostility to 1.6 billion followers of Islam.
In 
, government officials are scratching their heads about what Mr. Trump hopes to achieve by threatening to walk away from the trade agreement that has cemented bilateral relations for the last quarter-century. And who knows what Mr. Trump thinks the United States would stand to gain by leaving the World Trade Organization?
“What is a better Nafta?” asked Douglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College. “He hasn’t said.”
The posturing is not entirely surprising. Mr. Trump’s proposals to wall off the United States from a variety of foreign influences fit the promises he made to his base of working-class white voters, resentful of how trade and immigration have changed the country they claim as their own.
But Mr. Trump seems not to have grasped how consequential his proposals are. He is offering to kick down the set of understandings that shaped the cooperative equilibrium among the Western market democracies for more than half a century — a network of military alliances and trade agreements that underpinned the global order after the end of World War II.
What’s more, he shows no evidence of knowing what kind of alternative order he would like to build in their place. He is proposing a series of self-inflicted wounds with no ulterior goal in mind.
Why did the United States enter into Nafta? In part because it believed it stood to gain from trade but also because it thought Mexico would gain, too, and understood the benefit of helping its southern neighbor into the club of prosperous market democracies. Why did it allow China into the World Trade Organization? Perhaps because it benefited from binding what would inevitably become the world’s largest economy with a set of American-designed trade rules.
Cordell Hull, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s long-serving secretary of state and a key architect of postwar foreign strategy, once wrote, “if we could increase commercial exchanges among nations over lowered trade and tariff barriers and remove unnatural obstructions to trade, we would go a long way toward eliminating war itself.”
Mr. Trump has little patience for this thinking. The president understands international relations as zero-sum competitions. To win at trade, one must export, he believes. Importers lose. Mutually beneficial, win-win solutions are a figment of some diplomat’s imagination. The idea that the Trans-Pacific Partnership might serve American interests by cementing critical alliances with China’s neighbors in Asia is nonsense.
Can he shape foreign policy around a worldview like that? “The trade deficit is the number that determines for him who wins and loses,” Professor Irwin said. “But trade deficits are not determined by trade agreements. Trade agreements just determine the rules for trade.”
There is, of course, the possibility that Mr. Trump is a strategic genius, out to gain an edge over the nation’s rivals by convincing them he is prepared to engage in irrational, self-defeating behavior. “In foreign affairs, it makes sense to be insane,” noted David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
President Richard Nixon also tried this, in the 1970s. The idea has intellectual pedigree, developed by the strategic thinker 
, who played a critical role in developing the strategy of nuclear deterrence based on mutually assured destruction.
And yet it is difficult to see the genius in Mr. Trump’s first days in office. For starters, the crazy-person strategy works only in pursuit of some rational objective. What’s his? Mr. Trump has yet to articulate one. Having a zero trade deficit is not it.
Then there is the fact that Mr. Trump’s macroeconomic strategy, which looks set to marry increased government spending with high interest rates, is in some tension with his objectives on trade: By strengthening the value of the dollar, it will make the trade deficit bigger.
Finally, the problems that the president has resolved to tackle have largely petered out on their own. More Mexican immigrants are leaving the United States than coming in. And Chinese exports to the United States are actually declining.
Supporters might think there is little harm to Mr. Trump’s foreign policy realignment, even if it doesn’t achieve lasting benefits. They might want to ponder a point that the Nobel laureate 
 made: If somebody sat down next to you at a party and said he was Napoleon, would you engage in a discussion with him about cavalry tactics?
In other words, why get drawn into the minutiae of a technical discussion when the overall framework of the conversation is ludicrous? He was thinking of propositions by his fellow economists 
 and 
. Other countries, however, might apply it to the propositions of President Trump.
Last week, after Mr. Trump openly proclaimed that 
, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to the United States. Other officials in Mexico have been working to build an argument that 
, to deter American aggression.
What if every other country goes down this path? A new tit-for-tat world would most likely be uncomfortable for the United States as well.

"WASHINGTON — Anthony Scaramucci, an investment firm founder and a Republican donor, will not be taking a senior job at the White House as previously announced, a senior administration official said Wednesday.
Mr. Scaramucci was informed on Wednesday by Reince Priebus, President Trump’s chief of staff, and by Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist, that he would not get the job as liaison to the business community.
Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon, the official said, plan to find another role in the administration for Mr. Scaramucci in the future. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because Mr. Scaramucci’s name had not officially been withdrawn.
At issue is 
, SkyBridge Capital, to a division of HNA Group, a politically connected Chinese conglomerate that would become the firm’s majority owner. The sale has not been completed, and administration officials said the White House Counsel’s Office had predicted that it would take up to three months for Mr. Scaramucci to be cleared of potential ethics conflicts.
The White House is operating without a functioning Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, which Mr. Scaramucci would have led. Part of the job is to help coordinate matters across government agencies, a pressing need as protests over the president’s immigration order sweep the country.

 that HNA Group has strong ties to 
’s ruling Communist Party and an opaque ownership structure. China experts say leading Chinese firms like HNA are looking for avenues of influence in a White House that is already stoking tensions on trade and other issues.
HNA, a financial behemoth whose interests range from aviation to supermarkets, has said that SkyBridge will give it a foothold in America’s asset management business. The $180 million deal could be finalized as late as the end of June.
To avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Scaramucci had agreed to recuse himself from anything to do with SkyBridge and HNA. One ethics lawyer suggested that he could have steered clear of the entire financial services sector and still carried out his duties.
“This does not seem to me to be a clear disqualifying factor,” said Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer for two years under President George W. Bush. “Another possibility is they decided not to keep him for a political reason and cited an ethics conflict as a cover.”
This was not the first time that the Trump team has announced an appointment and later changed course. Mr. Trump’s choice for communications director backed out, as did a deputy National Security Council pick accused of plagiarism.","Anthony Scaramucci Won’t Get Announced White House Role, Official Says","FEB. 1, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/anthony-scaramucci-china-trump-administration.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MAGGIE HABERMAN
"WASHINGTON — President Trump told President 
 of 
 on Thursday evening that the United States would honor the “One China” policy, reversing his earlier expressions of doubt about the longtime diplomatic understanding and removing a major source of tension between the United States and China since shortly after he was elected.
In a statement, the White House said Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi “discussed numerous topics, and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy.” It described the call as “extremely cordial” and said the leaders had invited each other to visit.
The concession was clearly designed to put an end to an extended chill in the relationship between China and the United States. Mr. Xi, stung by Mr. Trump’s 
 with the president of Taiwan in December and his subsequent assertion that the United States might no longer abide by the One China policy, had not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov. 14, the week after he was elected.
Administration officials concluded that Mr. Xi would take a call only if Mr. Trump publicly committed to upholding the 44-year-old policy, under which the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Given the domestic political stakes of this issue for Mr. Xi, the fact that both sides went ahead with a call – and that the White House statement afterward acknowledged Mr. Trump’s acquiescence – suggested that the agreement on “one China” had been worked out beforehand.
The Chinese state news media, in its readout of the call, said Mr. Trump had “stressed that he fully understood the great importance for the U.S. government to respect the One China policy,” and that “the U.S. government adheres to the One China policy.”
It also said the two leaders had agreed on the “necessity and urgency of strengthening cooperation between China and the United States” and noted that Beijing wants to work with Washington on a range of issues, including the economy and trade, science, energy, communications and global stability.
The timing of the conversation was significant, as Mr. Trump is about to welcome Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, for an extravagant three-day visit that will include a weekend of golf in Florida — a visit that will be closely monitored in China.
Among the issues Mr. Trump is expected to discuss with Mr. Abe, is the president’s commitment to a mutual defense treaty with Japan, which surfaced during the campaign. At the time, Mr. Trump said he was prepared to pull back from the pact unless Tokyo did more to reimburse the United States for defending Japanese territory.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson met with officials at the White House to discuss issuing a statement about relations with China. His involvement was noteworthy because he had pledged, in written answers to questions after his Senate confirmation hearing, to uphold the One China policy.
Mr. Tillerson specifically rejected the idea, advanced by Mr. Trump, that Taiwan 
 in a broader negotiation with China on trade, security and other issues.
On Wednesday, the White House sent a letter from Mr. Trump to Mr. Xi wishing him a happy Chinese New Year, which administration officials described as an effort to keep the relationship from unraveling further while they sought to resolve the tensions.
Relations between Washington and Beijing had been frozen since December, when Mr. Trump took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen. The United States has not had diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1979, and Mr. Trump defended the call by saying he did not know why the United States should be bound by the One China policy.
To lay the groundwork for a better relationship, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, spoke last Friday with China’s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi. That call produced only a vague commitment to “reinforce high-level exchanges,” suggesting that Mr. Trump’s statements on China sill precluded a direct leader-to-leader exchange.
As a gesture of conciliation, Mr. Flynn and his deputy, K. T. McFarland, hand-delivered Mr. Trump’s letter to China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai. Mr. Trump wrote that he wished “the Chinese people a happy Lantern Festival and prosperous Year of the Rooster.” He also said he “looks forward to working with President Xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China.”
“This letter means they’re looking for creative ways to stabilize this relationship when Trump and Xi can’t talk due to differences over Taiwan policy,” said Evan S. Medeiros, who was senior director for Asia on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.
But there were indications that the administration recognized it needed to do more. Mr. Tillerson, officials said, suggested that Mr. Trump publicly reaffirm his commitment to the One China policy as a way of breaking the deadlock and getting the two presidents back on the phone.
For Mr. Trump, it was a significant reversal. In an interview with Fox News in December, he said the policy should be contingent on extracting concessions from Beijing.
“We’re being hurt very badly by China with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don’t tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South China Sea, which they shouldn’t be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea,” he said.
Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has spoken by phone with about 20 foreign leaders. Although these are usually highly scripted affairs, Mr. Trump’s have been anything but. His conversation last week with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia 
 when Mr. Turnbull urged Mr. Trump to honor an agreement made under Mr. Obama to accept 1,250 refugees from an offshore detention center.
But arguably, no bilateral relationship is more important than the one between Beijing and Washington, and the fact that Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi had not talked since Mr. Trump took office in January has drawn increasing scrutiny.
“The U.S.-China relationship only works if the two leaders have a serious relationship and use their contact to do real business,” Mr. Medeiros said. “Given the rigidity of the Chinese system, leader-level contact provides essential stability, direction and momentum to U.S.-China ties.”
Administration officials are also keenly aware that the Chinese will be closely watching the visit of Mr. Abe, which begins here Friday with an Oval Office meeting, a White House lunch and a joint news conference. Then Mr. Trump will take Mr. Abe to Palm Beach, Fla., on 
. The leaders plan to play golf at Mr. Trump’s club, Mar-a-Lago, and then they and their wives will have dinner there.
To the status-conscious Chinese, this red-carpet treatment will not go unnoticed. Analysts say it may reinforce their suspicion that the Trump administration is making Japan the centerpiece of its Asia strategy.
In Beijing, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, expressed thanks for Mr. Trump’s letter. He dismissed as “senseless” speculation the idea that Mr. Trump had been snubbing Mr. Xi by not scheduling a phone call earlier. “The two countries share wide common interests, and cooperation is the only correct path for both,” Mr. Lu told reporters on Thursday.
Even before the phone call, Mr. Trump and his advisers had markedly shifted their tone toward China since the inauguration.
During the campaign, Mr. Trump advocated a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States, complaining that China manipulated the value of its currency. This month, however, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, attended a Lunar New Year celebration at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. Her daughter, Arabella, sang a New Year’s greeting in Mandarin that was widely viewed in China.
Ms. Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, met with Mr. Cui before the embassy event, part of a blossoming dialogue between the two men.
The business relationships between some of Mr. Trump’s advisers and leading Chinese companies with close links to the Communist Party may also be strengthening ties. Mr. Kushner 
 with the Chinese billionaire Wu Xiaohui to help redevelop the Kushner family’s crown jewel, a commercial building on Fifth Avenue.
“It’s an expression of good will,” Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at Peking University, said of Mr. Trump’s letter. “It’s necessary to handle this relationship with practical cooperation.”",Trump Tells Xi Jinping U.S. Will Honor ‘One China’ Policy,"FEB. 9, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MARK LANDLER
"hen I first met Yang Jinkai, two days before he boarded a plane for America, the smog hanging over his industrial home city, Shenyang, had turned the sun into a ghostly orb. The 16-year-old paced around the family apartment as his mother labeled his suitcases and packed them with the comforts of home: quilted pajamas, chopsticks, instant noodles. She gestured toward a lone memento that would remain in his bedroom, a life-size needlepoint portrait of her only child, woven in shimmering gold thread. “I worked on that all year,” she said. “I knew this moment would come.”
Yang had never traveled outside China. But he had already chosen a new first name for his life in America, Korbin (“That sounds American, right?”), and was daydreaming about the adventure ahead. “It will be magical,” he said. “I’ll make lots of American friends. I’d like to have an American girlfriend. Maybe” — he shot a glance at his father — “I’ll even get a gun.” Over the summer, Korbin had been working on his English by watching, perhaps too zealously, the American television series “Criminal Minds.”
To help Korbin escape the competitive straitjacket of the Chinese education system, his father had paid nearly $40,000 to an education consultancy to get him enrolled in a public high school in Michigan. The Yang family’s ultimate goal was for Korbin to attend a top American university, and the name of his new high school, Oxford, only added to the allure. It didn’t matter that the place had no connection to the British university or that this Oxford was a small town north of Detroit. “My father,” Korbin said, “really likes the idea of an Oxford diploma.”
Even as U.S.-China relations have slipped toward mutual antagonism, the flood of Chinese students coming to the United States has continued to rise. Roughly 370,000 students from the mainland are enrolled in American high schools and universities, six times more than a decade ago. Their financial impact — $11.4 billion was contributed to the American economy in 2015, according to the Department of Commerce — has turned education into one of America’s top “exports” to China.
It is a strange historical moment when the elites of a rising power send their only sons and daughters, products of China’s former one-child policy, to the schools of a geopolitical rival. Yet the idea of a liberal Western education exerts an almost talismanic hold over China’s ruling classes. While the country’s educational emphasis on rote memorization churns out some of the world’s best test-takers, many Chinese families harbor worries that diverge sharply from those of the tiger parents of popular conception. They fret about the toll competition exacts from their coddled offspring; they wonder if their child’s creativity is being stifled. Even President Xi Jinping, who is presiding over a crackdown on Western influences in China’s schools, allowed his daughter to attend Harvard. According to a 2016 survey conducted by a Shanghai-based research firm, 83 percent of China’s millionaires are planning to send their children to school abroad. The average age, according to the poll, has dropped to 16 today from 18 in 2014 — the first time it has reached the high-school level.
In 2005, only 641 Chinese students were enrolled in American high schools. By 2014, that student population approached 40,000 — a 60-fold increase in a single decade — and it now accounts for nearly half of all international high-school students in the United States. “Parents realize that they have to start earlier if they want their children to get into a top U.S. university,” says Nini Suet, founder of Shang Learning, a boutique consultancy with headquarters in Beijing that charges $25,000 to $40,000 to help Chinese kids prepare for and apply to American boarding schools. “Families are looking for any edge they can get.”
As a new administration vowing “America First” settles into the White House, there is uncertainty about how long this phenomenon can last. It already faces headwinds within China. A slowing economy has cut into family savings, and a depreciating currency makes American educations more expensive. There are also fewer Chinese students to go around: The population of 18-to-23-year-olds has dropped by nearly a quarter in the last decade.
But the exodus of Chinese students continues for now, driven not just by a push from China but also by a pull from the United States. For each rich Chinese kid who enters an American school — whether public or private, college or high school — the multiplier effect means that entire communities can be buoyed by the buying power of the world’s second-largest economy.
That’s the hope, at least. The reality is more complicated. Much of the money spent by Chinese families desperate for American diplomas ends up with the intermediary companies that connect them with cash-hungry schools. These matches have yielded unusual results. According to an article in Foreign Policy magazine, nearly 60 percent of the high-school students end up in religious schools, despite coming from the world’s largest atheist state. (Their parents welcome the messages of safety, discipline and moral values that emanate from these faith-based institutions.) Another cohort winds up in what are effectively diploma mills, which confer visas and credentials but little adult supervision.
Public high schools are the newest frontier: Less than 5 percent of all Chinese “parachute kids” (as they’ve come to be called) are currently in public schools, but certain U.S. school districts have begun to rely on them to offset budget cuts and increase cultural diversity at the same time as private academies are reaching saturation points.
Few public school districts have deeper ties to China than Oxford, Mich., outside Detroit. In 2010, the town sought to create the first pipeline of Chinese students into a public high school, one that embodied its high school’s motto — “where the globe is our classroom” — even as it brought tuition money to the school. As the number of foreign students grew, other Midwestern schools sought to emulate Oxford’s success. But when a Beijing education company proposed building a multimillion-dollar dormitory for Chinese students on the Oxford campus, a community battle ensued.
Chance put Korbin’s family at the starting point of Oxford’s experiment, in Shenyang. His parents grew up without proper educations in rural villages haunted by the memories of famine. His father, Yang Huaiguo, migrated to Shenyang and scavenged for scrap metal before finding success in the boiler-repair business and real estate. But he worried about Korbin’s education and the almost unrelenting pressure to study for the two exams that determine a Chinese student’s future: the high-school entrance exam, the 
, and the university-entrance exam, the 
. There seemed to be no way out, until Korbin’s school opened an international wing in partnership with Oxford. The pitch was enticing: After spending 10th grade in the program, Korbin was guaranteed a place at Oxford High School for two years, until graduation.
His father insisted that this wasn’t just about family prestige or future job prospects. “I also want my son to understand, in a way that I never could,” he said, “that the world is bigger than Shenyang, bigger than China.”
days in Oxford, Korbin marveled at the blue skies, so different from northeastern China, and the absence of skyscrapers. All of America, in his TV-fueled imagination, was supposed to look like New York. Beyond its main street and century-old storefronts, Oxford (population 3,500) is a patchwork of gravel pits and horse stables, wooded subdivisions and a strip mall containing a single Chinese restaurant. Korbin’s host family lived in a house on a leafy cul-de-sac, with two basketball hoops in the driveway and a trampoline out back. Suddenly Korbin had four blond American siblings and a host mother he called “Mom.” His host father worked as an engineer in an automobile industry that blamed the loss of thousands of jobs in the last recession on a single culprit: China.
Korbin immersed himself in Americana: football games, big-box stores, even a Christian megachurch with its own rock band. He was hardly alone in his American adventure. Michigan has become a particularly popular destination for Chinese public-high-school students in the United States, and more than a dozen kids from Shenyang lived nearby. Even at Oxford, where Korbin and 23 other students ended up because their academic program in China and its agent, the BCC International Education Group, had partnered with the school, there were another 19 Chinese kids brought in by a Beijing-based company, Weiming Education Group. The two crowds didn’t mix much, in part because most of the Weiming students lived in a dormitory at Rochester College, a liberal-arts Christian school half an hour away. Korbin felt lucky with his American home stay.
His life in America was very different from that of his predecessors. When the first Chinese students arrived in the United States in the wake of the Cultural Revolution — and later, after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre — many were so poor that they collected aluminum cans or worked janitorial jobs to survive. Today’s Chinese students tend to be far wealthier than their American counterparts, particularly in public high schools. Even among the middle-class students at Oxford, the Chinese kids stirred up envy, and some resentment, by flaunting multiple versions of just-released iPhones. (Korbin had only one.) The Chinese boys carried hundreds of dollars in cash and often wore a different pair of designer sneakers — Nike, Puma, Adidas — each day. Korbin’s Chinese housemate, Oscar Kou, who liked to talk about his father’s fleet of luxury cars, spent several thousand dollars on a laptop so powerful that it blew out the fuses in their host family’s house.
Making American friends wasn’t as simple as Korbin had imagined. In the hallways at Oxford High School, whose student body numbers 1,845, the Chinese kids clustered together, chattering in Mandarin. Korbin longed to interact with his American classmates, but every time he tried, the conversations fizzled when he couldn’t understand their cultural references or slang. Still, Korbin made no secret of his mission. “I’m a Chinese boy,” he told his classes, “but I really, really want to make American friends. It’s the most important thing to me.”
Perhaps his best chance came at the homecoming dance that fall. As he walked across the floor under the spinning lights of a disco ball, Korbin worked up his nerve and asked an American girl to dance. She just laughed. Another girl, another rejection. Finally, the third entreaty succeeded — just as a slow song started up and the dancers turned into a tangle of embracing couples. Korbin’s feet stopped, and his arms locked at his sides. “I totally froze,” he says. The girl drifted off to rejoin her friends, leaving Korbin alone, wondering if a Chinese boy could ever find his footing in America.
 encounter with William Skilling took place in the Beijing Capital International Airport, as mine did, it would be easy to take him for a missionary. Dressed in crisply ironed khakis and a white button-down shirt, his short hair meticulously combed, he was headed to a dusty city in the Chinese interior. As superintendent of Oxford Community Schools, Skilling did see himself as a sort of evangelist for global education. On this trip to China, his 19th, he was reviewing plans for Weiming to build its multimillion-dollar dorm on land bordering Oxford High School. “It will be the first of its kind at any American public school,” he said.
For Skilling, a former high-school government and economics teacher, the dorm project was the culmination of years of networking with Chinese officials, educators and businessmen. His first foray into the China market came in 2008, when with the Chinese government’s help he started what would become one of the largest Mandarin-language programs in American schools. Today more than 2,300 students in Oxford schools, K through 12, take daily classes in Chinese. “The greatest challenge we face in American education,” Skilling said, “is preparing students to work and live in a global world that is changing 24-7.” The Mandarin classes were also part of a local government plan to lure Chinese investment to southeastern Michigan. “There was a reason that we, as a state, weren’t making inroads into China,” Skilling told me. “The Chinese knew Michigan was negative, blaming China for its woes. The way to turn this around was to pay China the highest compliment: by building a world-class Mandarin-language program.”
Beijing returned the favor. In 2013, Hanban — the state agency that runs China’s network of controversial Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese culture, language and propaganda worldwide — recognized Oxford Community Schools as the “Confucius Classroom of the Year.” Skilling parlayed such recognition into sister-school agreements with 20 Chinese schools. Over the past seven years, at least 40 different Oxford teachers and administrators have visited China. One major deal was struck with Korbin’s public school in Shenyang, which opened an international school for Chinese students, like Korbin, aiming to go to an American high school with a famous name.
With that deal, Skilling had lined up his first supply of Chinese students for Oxford. He also devised a way around the United States regulations that restricted international students to just one year in public high schools. By inviting a local college to sponsor the F-1 student visas for Chinese students in their second year, Skilling maintained that they could remain at the high school — and keep paying tuition — so long as they were also enrolled in and paying tuition for full-time college-level courses. The second year was important: Chinese families want their children to have enough time to prepare for the American college process. The Department of Homeland Security raised no immediate objections, Skilling told me. “This had never been done before, so there were no regulations or road maps to follow,” he said. “This was literally a blank slate.”
Soon, Oxford was attracting Chinese companies with even bigger ambitions. In a trip to Michigan in late 2012, Weiming’s president, Lin Hao, laid out a vision in which 10,000 Chinese students would enroll in high schools in the United States, starting with experimental districts in the American heartland. Weiming, which bills itself as one of China’s largest private education companies, has followed a similar strategy at home, building 15 campuses with more than 30,000 students in nine provincial cities. As Lin told a visiting superintendent from rural southern Ohio: “In China, we have an old saying: ‘Revolution begins in the countryside.’ ”
Within a year, Oxford signed a memorandum of understanding with Weiming that ensured an even greater supply of Chinese students — up to 200 of them annually for the next 20 years. For each student, Weiming would pay Oxford Community Schools $10,000 a year. It was a boon for a district facing budgetary pressures, but it was significantly less than the $40,000 that Chinese families paid Weiming for the full package of tuition, room and board, insurance and English-support classes. (The company says its fees have since gone down to about $30,500, as it competes for China’s middle-class market.)
Weiming also offered American public schools a bigger prize. If the number of Chinese students reached a certain threshold — from 80 to 100 students — the company promised to build a multimillion-dollar student center and dormitory, at no cost to the school. As the Weiming contingent at Oxford grew, architects in Beijing and Michigan began drawing up blueprints for the dorm. Shortly after I met Skilling at the airport in the spring of 2014, he returned to Beijing to pore over blueprints of the proposed dorm with Lin. They met in Lin’s office, which was designed to replicate the room where Chairman Mao met President Nixon in 1972 to re-establish relations between their two countries. The wall behind Lin’s desk is covered with antique maps, one for each Chinese province where Weiming has built a school. It wouldn’t be long, perhaps, before a map of Michigan adorned the wall. “Lin Hao and I understand each other,” Skilling told me, “because we’re both visionaries.”
Oxford High School started blaring halfway through Korbin’s music-appreciation class. “This is a lockdown!” a voice announced. “An armed intruder has entered the building!” Korbin’s classmates leapt from their seats and, crouching low, rushed toward the door.
Korbin didn’t understand the commotion. His English had improved, but his vocabulary was limited — and the loudspeakers were always a challenge. He had gotten used to the rock music that played between classes, creating the kind of happy chaos that would never be allowed in a regimented Chinese school. But this time the tone was grave: “Teachers, secure your classrooms!” Korbin’s confusion only deepened when the music instructor hustled everyone into the girls’ bathroom next door. “Hurry up!” she yelled. When Korbin made it to the bathroom stalls, the teacher locked the door behind him — and they waited, in hushed excitement, until the drill was over.
Later, Korbin laughed about the experience. He had nearly forgotten that his mother’s fears about American life — the guns, riots, school shootings — had almost scuttled his chances of studying in the United States. His father had made a reconnaissance visit to the country before he started, largely to reassure his wife that it was safe enough for their son. The only dangers Korbin faced in Oxford came from his innocent campaign for American friends.
One day, a group of jocks and slackers invited Korbin into the boys’ bathroom for a few puffs from an electronic cigarette. The initiation was unusual for a strait-laced Chinese kid, but he was thrilled to be part of an American posse. “Cool kids never study,” he was told, so Korbin, until then a conscientious A student, eased off his schoolwork. He started lifting weights, thinking he might attract a girlfriend “after I build some muscle.”
But when his new friends began pressing Korbin to join in hazing other kids, he pulled away. He wanted nothing to do with shouting racial epithets at the school’s few African-American students or taunting other Chinese kids with curse words in Mandarin. “I tried so hard to make American friends, but I lost all of my own Chinese style and character,” Korbin told me last year. “I am not that eager to be part of American culture anymore. I would like to be myself, Chinese.”
With this part of his American dream tarnished, Korbin buried himself in his studies — and emerged as a patriot. In September 2015, after Beijing held a missile-studded military parade to celebrate Japan’s defeat in World War II, he posted a picture on social media of the Chinese flag with the words “Great China!” At school, he nearly came to blows with a student who was badmouthing the Chinese “dictatorship.” The object of his anger was not an American but a fellow Chinese student.
Korbin and Oscar left their host family and moved in with four other Chinese students under the care of a local grandmother. Korbin stopped lifting weights. He no longer wanted an American girlfriend. He barely interacted with American students anyway, because everyone in his college-level classes — the requirement to maintain his visa during his second year — was Chinese.
Still, Korbin remembers his senior year fondly. After he regained his academic focus, his grade-point average rose to near the top of his class — a 3.96 — and his standardized-test scores climbed just in time for his college applications. It felt good to be a nerd again. “I realized that I’m an only son, the last of my family,” he told me. “My parents pay a lot for me to come here, so why shouldn’t I study hard?”
 for the meeting about the Chinese invasion?”
I had just pulled into the Oxford school parking lot when a bearded man in a baseball cap, an auto engineer, appeared at my car window and grumbled about the subject of that night’s public forum: Weiming’s plan to build its Oxford High School dorm. “Is it really our job to be educating Chinese kids?” he asked.
Until October 2014, Oxford’s move into China’s orbit — the Mandarin-language program, the influx of Chinese students — had met little resistance. But the proposed dorm for Chinese students hit a nerve. A board meeting erupted in chaos. The local newspaper, The Oxford Leader, ran an editorial titled “Making a Deal With the Devil.” And now, as the engineer and 60 other residents gathered in the school atrium, Skilling found himself on the defensive. “I’m here to defuse the situation,” he said.
After touting the benefits of cultural exchange, Skilling outlined the finances. When the school reached its goal of 200 tuition-paying Chinese students, he said, an estimated $1.3 million in annual net revenue would flow into school coffers. The bigger incentive, he argued, was the multimillion-dollar dorm, which would include eight classrooms for use by all students. “We don’t pay a penny,” Skilling said. “It’s a win-win.”
Near the end of a contentious question-and-answer session, Skilling talked about how this project would bring money from China back into Michigan. “You’ve heard Donald Trump say that China is trying to take advantage of us,” he said. “I agree. We’re willing to sell our souls to get a foot in China, and it’s a mistake.” A woman behind me whispered to her companion: “But isn’t that just what he’s done?”
Behind the scenes, a group of Oxford citizens began looking into the international program. “I don’t think the community objects to having foreign students here,” says Kallie Roesner-Meyers, a horse-stable owner who started the group, known as Team 20. “But there was so much secrecy and misinformation around the whole China setup that we needed to find out more.” In the spring of 2015, Team 20, which sent the district a flurry of Freedom of Information Act requests, discovered, among other things, that the school board had agreed to a 20-year deal based on Skilling’s recommendation.
In response to communication from Roesner-Meyers, federal agents questioned Skilling about his consulting work for Weiming. (Skilling says he ceased consulting before the Oxford deal went through.) One of them also wanted to know more about the visa maneuver by which Chinese students were staying for two years instead of one. According to Skilling, the agents said they “didn’t see any issue,” and he told a reporter that Roesner-Meyers “needs to settle down.” But the pressure only persisted. Skilling retired later that year, and Weiming, without giving any explanation, put the dorm project on hold.
Weiming still has roughly 100 of its students at Oxford. And with thousands more students in its Chinese schools expecting to come to the United States, the search for a flagship location continues. In 2015, the company bid $12.6 million for a 58-acre property in West Hartford, Conn. It proposed to turn the former University of Connecticut site into an international school for 500 students, some of whom would feed into the city’s public high schools. Local officials supported the plan, but last May the City Council, responding to vocal opposition to a little-known Chinese company taking control of land in the city center, voted against it.
Hovering in the background of the West Hartford debate was the suspension of the Weiming dorm in Oxford — and the government’s unresolved investigation into its international program. By November, the Department of Homeland Security offered a verdict. The visa maneuver would not be permitted in the future, a blow to the model Oxford pioneered.
Oxford has not been punished, but it will no longer be allowed to keep Chinese students for more than one year on its campus. The current crop of 41 second-year Chinese students has been allowed to stay, though they must now take all of their classes at Rochester College, the institution that sponsors their visas, instead of Oxford High School. In June, after a semester of isolation, these kids will even earn their high-school diplomas. The future of the first-year students is up in the air. They may not be able to graduate from Oxford next year, and it is too late to re-enter China’s 
 system. So they and their families may be back on the international-student carousel, scrambling to find another school to attend next year.
at Oxford High School’s graduation ceremony last June put Korbin Yang in one of the last rows, surrounded by a clutch of Chinese classmates whose surnames begin with the letters X, Y or Z. They formed a sort of school-within-a-school, watching the parade of American graduates they barely knew. Many local students received raucous ovations as they crossed the stage. Korbin’s name — “graduating summa cum laude, Jinkai Yang” — elicited only a muffled clap or two. In the fall, Korbin headed to Pennsylvania State University. His parents were proud that he had gotten into a Top 50 university where almost 2,500 Chinese students were already enrolled.
When I visited Korbin last summer in Shenyang, he took me to an American-style craft-beer pub his father partly owns. Over a game of pool, he spoke positively about his experience at Oxford. Still, he admitted, he left Michigan after two years without a single American friend. That surprised him. “Weirdly, I think the experience made me appreciate Chinese culture even more,” he said. It’s a common sentiment among Chinese students abroad, who find that their foreign experiences sharpen their sense of national pride. Over the summer, Korbin started delving into Chinese history books and training in kung fu. In America, he found his Chinese core.
Now halfway through his first year at Penn State, Korbin can spend entire days without speaking a word of English. “I’m around my Chinese friends all the time,” he says. “I can’t get a chance to know American friends.” The current political climate may only isolate him further. Korbin is in America legally, studying hard and leaning toward a major in electrical engineering. But how welcoming is a country that increasingly regards his homeland as an economic and security threat? If Trump is serious about being tough on trade, Chinese students, while not in the foreground of such a fight, could be an easy lever for either side to pull. The collateral damage of restricting visas would be devastating, not only for the students themselves but also for high schools and universities, especially across the Midwest, that have become dependent on the billions of dollars the Chinese contribute economically every year.
An even bigger threat may lie within China. Late last year, President Xi’s ideological campaign against foreign influences targeted the kind of schools that prepared Korbin for America. How this crackdown will affect the flow of Chinese students overseas is unclear. Parents may be compelled to send their children abroad at even younger ages to escape the closing cage.
For Korbin, the lack of American buddies and reawakened sense of national identity notwithstanding, high school in America still left a deep impression on him. Last Christmas, after exams, he went back not to Shenyang, but to Oxford. His second host mother gave him two hoodies and some of his favorite chocolate, and cooked a Christmas meal. Korbin presented her with a mug and played with the dogs he had helped care for as puppies. “I definitely wish I was still there,” he told me, and he sounded like just another first-year college kid, missing home.",,"FEB. 2, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/magazine/the-parachute-generation.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,BROOK LARMER
"CANBERRA, Australia — The United States-
 alliance faces a crucial test over how to deal with a powerful and increasingly assertive China. Under President Trump, it is already failing.
The 
 last week between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in which the president denounced a 
 made between the United States and Australia under President Obama, showed Australians that they can no longer trust America. As a result of Mr. Trump’s approach, Australia will drift away from America and move closer to China.
Mr. Obama’s ineffectual “
” undermined confidence among Australians that Washington had the resolve to resist Beijing’s ambitions, or the finesse to do so without provoking a war. Mr. Trump is making that worse.
No one in Australia wants this to happen. Australia has benefited as much as any other country from the peace and stability that American leadership has brought to Asia. No country feels closer to America in its core values.
But China has become extraordinarily important to Australia economically. China is by far the biggest market for Australia, the destination for more than 30 percent of its exports, and the trade balance remains strongly in Australia’s favor. Sales to China are five times that to America.
As its economic clout has increased, China has become more assertive politically, seeking to displace the United States as Asia’s leading power. It has built China-centered regional economic institutions like the 
, and challenged American military superiority with forays into the East and 
 and by 
 American allies in the region.
We Australians have looked to Washington to respond. We have hoped that a deft display of American resolve would deflect or deter China’s challenge to the regional order without provoking the kind of confrontation that would force Australia to choose between our biggest trading partner and our closest ally.
These hopes began to erode with Mr. Obama’s attempts to contain China’s assertiveness. He discouraged countries from joining China’s infrastructure bank, but they signed up anyway. He looked weak when his administration talked tough about Chinese actions in the South China Sea but responded only with timid freedom-of-navigation operations that China ignored.
And worst of all, the 
, pitched by Mr. Obama as a showcase of America’s resolve to lead in Asia, ended up doing just the opposite when he couldn’t sell it to Congress.
No one doubts that, even at today’s slower rates of growth, China remains by far the most important source of future economic opportunities for Australia — and for every other country in Asia. A good relationship with China is essential for Australia’s future. And inevitably, China’s influence on regional affairs, even on Australia domestic politics, has expanded, too. Australians were shocked last year when a rising political star was found to be 
 connected to the government in Beijing. For Australians, Beijing is everywhere.
There is real fear here that any diplomatic rupture with China would have swift and devastating economic consequences. That would dash hopes for Australian prosperity, and doom any government that allowed it to happen.
Balancing between Washington and Beijing was always going to be an immense challenge for Australia over the next few years no matter who had won the White House. But with Mr. Trump, the choices have become far starker, faster than anyone had imagined. While his apparent eagerness for confrontation with China raises fears that he will provoke a crisis, Mr. Trump’s “America First” nationalism suggests that he will not sustain United States leadership in Asia in the long term.
And Mr. Trump believes that allies are dispensable. A leader who would deal with a fellow leader the way Mr. Trump dealt with Mr. Turnbull cannot be trusted to handle China in a way that protects Australia’s interests.
Australia cannot risk supporting America at the expense of its relationship with China. Much against our will, we will move closer to China and further from America.
That does not mean we Australians will become Beijing’s ally, but it does mean we will begin tacitly to acquiesce to China’s claims to regional leadership. This is how America’s long era of leadership in Asia comes to an end.",Trump Pushes Australia Toward China,"FEB. 9, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/opinion/trump-pushes-australia-toward-china.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,HUGH WHITE
"PEARL RIVER DELTA, China — As Wong Kin-kao stands on the deck of the traditional Chinese wooden junk he is building in Shenwan, a cluster of fish ponds and factories in the Pearl River Delta of southern China, he shouts to be heard over the shriek of metalwork from steel ships that are being worked on nearby.
“It’s like a piece of art,” said Mr. Wong, a bronzed 54-year-old with stony hands and a quick grin, describing what he loves about the scimitar-shaped boats with the batwing sails that he so rarely gets to build.
A native of the delta region, Mr. Wong in 1982 swam for two hours from nearby Zhuhai, on China’s mainland, to what was then the Portuguese colony of 
 to escape China’s strict Communist government. Once there he set up an early incarnation of 
, a builder of wooden junks, which symbolize the delta and the maritime culture that drove China’s early growth.
“Not many people are hand-making wooden junks anymore,” Mr. Wong said. “I wish more people would.”
Within the next few months, the junk, the Dai Cheung Po — also known as the Aqua Luna II — will unfurl its blood-red sails above its high stern and low bow and join its smaller sister, the Cheung Po Tsai, or the 
, already in Victoria Harbor in 
, to offer parties and dinners.
It is one of a few of these traditional ships with sails being made by one of the last remaining junk builders in China.
“The building tradition is more or less moribund,” said 
, a former director of the 
.
Yet the style remains traditional, “insofar as they are still doing what Grandpa did, and before him,” he said.
The new junk is made of Southeast Asian ironwood and teak and cost about $1.3 million to build. It was commissioned by a restaurant group in Hong Kong, which lies about 50 miles east of Shenwan on the edge of the delta where the river’s silty water turns ocean blue.
Also in Hong Kong is the 
, a classic, red-sailed junk that dates from 1955. It sank once and was recently refurbished. Since June, its owners have offered tours of Hong Kong’s waters, reflecting how junks today are used mostly for tourism and private parties.
They are three of only a handful of junks that remain in the delta, replaced long ago by stouter wooden fishing vessels without sails, speedboats and huge container ships.
The 19th-century pirate Cheung Po Tsai, or Cheung Po “the Kid,” who crisscrossed the delta pillaging and later joined the Qing dynasty imperial navy, sailed a ship that looked similar to his namesakes, though its sails may have been a yellow woven bamboo, not red. The red color is largely a flourish, Mr. Davies said.
The life of the delta is partly interlaced because of junks, which were once numerous with their fanlike silhouettes, trading down into Southeast Asia and up the coast of China.
The junk — the word’s origins are murky, with Chinese, Malay and Portuguese cited as influences — may have assumed its iconic, curved hull and sails about 
, during the Song dynasty, though written records are scarce.
Captivated by the junk’s beauty, 
, the founder and owner of 
, commissioned a Hong Kong master boat builder, Au Wai, to conceptualize and direct the construction of the Aqua Lunas and to work with Mr. Wong in Shenwan. The first was launched in 2006, and unlike junks of the past, both are motor-powered, and their sails are decorative.
“He has made more commercial junk boats than anyone else in Hong Kong. He is a master of a true art form,” Mr. Yeo said in an email. “An art form that is sadly dying out in Hong Kong today.”
Mr. Au’s life reflects the sweep of delta geography. He is unsure where he was born but knows his father was from Guangdong Province in China, through which the Pearl River runs.
Known as Ah Sin — the honorific and name translate as Dear Magician, for his talent — Mr. Au, 85, grew up poor in Hong Kong.
In his boatyard on Hong Kong Island, in the eastern district of Shau Kei Wan, he points to photographs of wooden ships of all kinds that he has built since being apprenticed to an uncle at the age of 13: simple “walla-walla” motorboats and corporate junks that carry some design elements of the traditional junk but without sails.
Beyond the wood shavings, the harbor glitters in the sun. Fishing boats draw up outside to deliver their catch to the next-door Shau Kei Wan wholesale fish market.
“I was very naughty as a boy, and no one could control me,” Mr. Au said in Cantonese, the local language. Barely a teenager, he sold fish on the streets.
“I did what I wanted. So my family said, ‘You should look for a special skill,’” he said. “An uncle was the owner of a shipyard and also a member of the ship association.”
His son, Au Sai Kit, works with him, but because his son has no children, the family tradition will probably end there.
Hardly anyone in Hong Kong is willing to do manual labor, the elder Mr. Au said, so he has to look to places like Shenwan, where he and his son travel regularly to confer with Mr. Wong and his team of workers.
Building a luxury junk is a labor of love, Mr. Au said.
“We take the wood piece by piece, fit them together in a curve, measure each piece and cut it,” he said. Copper nails are used to hammer the hull together. No other metal or artificial materials are used.
It takes about a year to build a traditional junk, Mr. Wong said.
Once junks were made from camphor wood and pine from next-door Fujian Province, said Mr. Davies, the former museum director.
“They were simple to build. That was the genius of the hull design,” he said.
But they had flaws.
“The hull is only joined together by nails, so you can’t have one high sail. You need low-stress rigging,” he said. “They had to keep adding sails to make the junk sail in a straight line.”
The idea of a Chinese junk has been romanticized, Mr. Davies said.
“Junks were brutally hard work. The grunt work — it took 14 members of crew to work the sails. It was pure sweat,” he said.
But Mr. Davies concedes that the traditional Chinese junk remains iconic.
“That sweep down to the bow, the fan in profile, with the masts that create this beautiful arc along the top. The fully battened, standing rigging. There is just a beautiful harmony in looking at it,” he said.","On Deck With China’s Last Junk Builders, Masters of an Ebbing Craft","FEB. 2, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/asia/china-junk-builders-hong-kong.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW
"HONG KONG — After Intel and Foxconn said they would build advanced factories in America, it might have seemed as if the United States were gaining high-end manufacturing momentum.
But on Friday, the California-based chip maker GlobalFoundries announced a $10 billion project in China, showing how the center of gravity continues to shift across the Pacific.
The new advanced semiconductor factory, in the central Chinese city of Chengdu, is only the most recent in an array of investments, often by major multinationals, into China with the support of the Chinese government. The projects have become markedly more sophisticated, making more modern microchips, memory chips or flat-panel displays.
The reason for the shift is in part the Chinese government. In 2013 Beijing announced a major initiative to expand the country’s ability to produce microchips, which act as the brains of everything from guided missiles to smartphones. Also driving the companies, according to analysts, are new guidelines urging Chinese electronics makers to buy chips made in China.
Since China has begun focusing on semiconductors, the provenance of advanced chips has become an increasingly fraught political issue. The United States government has blocked several Chinese deals for American and European chip companies during the past two years, and a commission created by former President Barack Obama said China’s chip policies posed a risk to American companies.
The election of President Trump has further increased pressure on companies, several of which have announced plans to build facilities in America. In Intel’s case, 
 the company had announced.
Leading China’s charge have been both the central and provincial governments, which have been spending billions of dollars on investments and subsidies. The government has said China will spend about $100 billion to bring chip factories and research facilities to China.
“Almost all of the large semiconductor enterprises in the United States have received investment offers from Chinese state actors,” according to a report from the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a think tank based in Germany. The report added that China’s newest industrial policy, Made in China 2025, had named semiconductors as a crucial area to improve.
Although analysts remain unsure of how quickly China might be able to close a huge gap with companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States, the funds have been slowly attracting new plants. A semiconductor industry group said in a recent report that it was tracking the production of more than 
 in China.
“Such spending momentum will drive China to the top-tier bracket for fab equipment and is paving the way to establish China’s position on the global semiconductor stage,” according to a recent report by SEMI, a global microelectronics industry association, referring to tools used to fabricate chips.
The GlobalFoundries project is being built in cooperation with the Chengdu municipal government. GlobalFoundries declined to specify the amount of the investment, but several documents on government websites put the total project around $10 billion.
Jason Gorss, a GlobalFoundries spokesman, declined to provide financial details but said in an email that “industry analysts estimate that the total cost of an advanced semiconductor fab is on the order of $10B and this fab will be in that range.” It is not clear how much investment is being provided by the company and how much by the Chengdu government.
Although the semiconductors produced at the plant will be a generation behind the most cutting-edge chip technology, they are based on a special design that is likely to make them useful in sensors for mobile devices, cars and other gadgets that are increasingly being connected to computer networks.
GlobalFoundries is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and owned by Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates. The company has semiconductor plants across the world, including two former IBM plants in the United States that it uses to make chips for the American military.
Although Intel and Foxconn have said they have plans to build in America, the factories being built in China greatly outnumber them.
In late 2015, a leading chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, said it 
 a production facility in China despite longtime concerns from Taiwan’s government about insulating the industry from Chinese competition and potential intellectual property theft. Late last year, another major chip maker from Taiwan, United Microelectronics, said it would build a factory on the east coast of China.
Other companies have taken different approaches. The American chip maker AMD has licensed technology to a Chinese joint venture, also in Chengdu. IBM has licensed chip technology to a separate local partner.",Plan for $10 Billion Chip Plant Shows China’s Growing Pull,"FEB. 10, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/business/china-computer-chips-globalfoundries-investment.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,PAUL MOZUR
"HONG KONG — In a newspaper ad, the 
 billionaire declared that he was just fine, merely resting overseas. The local news media insists that he is helping with an important investigation in 
. The police say he left the territory through a normal border control point.
But Xiao Jianhua, one of China’s wealthiest and 
, whose 
 sent a chill through Hong Kong and the political class in Beijing, does not appear to be fine.
In the early hours of Jan. 27, he was taken out of the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong in a wheelchair, his head covered by a sheet or a blanket, according to people who have seen or been briefed on video footage captured by security cameras in the hotel.
Mr. Xiao, 45, who was not known to use a wheelchair, was accompanied by about half a dozen unidentified men who were also pushing a large suitcase on rollers. He is believed to have been transported by boat from Hong Kong, eluding border controls, and is now in police custody in mainland China, according to two people familiar with the investigation into his whereabouts.
While the reasons for his apparent abduction remain a mystery, it comes ahead of an important Communist Party leadership meeting this year that will fill top posts, leading to speculation that someone powerful may have wanted Mr. Xiao out of the way, or perhaps wanted to use him to silence rivals with whom he has business ties.
Few people are in a position to know more about the financial holdings of China’s leading political families than Mr. Xiao, who made billions investing in banks, insurers and real estate around the world. In the past decade, he has served as a de facto banker to the Communist Party elite.
His disappearance has again raised fears about Chinese encroachment into Hong Kong in violation of the “one country, two systems” rule that allows this former British colony to run its own affairs and bars mainland security forces from operating here. A year ago, the city was outraged when 
 disappeared — only to turn up in Chinese custody.
Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said Mr. Xiao’s extraction from Hong Kong was unlikely to have occurred without the approval of China’s president, 
, who has challenged party traditions of collective leadership with a bold drive to consolidate power.
Mr. Tsang said Mr. Xi might be holding Mr. Xiao in custody to protect himself or to gain leverage against people he “needs to persuade” at the coming party congress to push through his agenda and cement his legacy.
“I do not know if the operation was initiated or ordered by Xi, but his consent must have been given, in light of Xiao’s connections with Xi’s family,” Mr. Tsang said in an email.
In January 2013, weeks after Mr. Xi came into power at the last party congress, his sister and brother-in-law sold their stake in an investment firm to a company founded by Mr. Xiao. Mr. Xiao later said the move was part of an effort by the Xi family to 
, which reduced Mr. Xi’s political vulnerability as he embarked on a sweeping campaign against corruption.
But Mr. Xiao also appears to have done business with relatives of other party leaders, including Zeng Qinghong, a former vice president and power broker whom Mr. Xi may consider a potential threat.
A Chinese-born Canadian citizen with an Antiguan diplomatic passport, Mr. Xiao has lived in a 
 at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong for years, attended to by a coterie of female bodyguards.
On the night he disappeared, the men in plain clothes were recorded by closed-circuit security cameras entering his suite with a wheelchair and the large suitcase, according to one of the people familiar with the footage.
Some time later, the men emerged from the suite with Mr. Xiao in the wheelchair, along with several women and the suitcase. Mr. Xiao was not struggling but seemed fatigued and his head was covered, according to the people familiar with the video. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the news media or feared retaliation by the Chinese government.
The lobby of the Four Seasons apartment tower is separate from the main hotel, with its own front desk and a single door that opens with a key card. Hotel staff members there questioned the men who left with Mr. Xiao, and they were told that the men were part of his security detail and that he was ill and needed medical attention, the people said.
Mr. Xiao’s disappearance has been marked by confusion and misinformation.
His flagship company, The Tomorrow Group, printed a front-page advertisement in Mr. Xiao’s name on Feb. 1 in Ming Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper, saying that he had not been abducted and that he was “recuperating abroad.” But that was a lie meant to appease the Chinese government, which did not want his case discussed in the news media, one person close to Mr. Xiao’s family said at the time.
Days after the apparent abduction, the Hong Kong police disclosed that one of Mr. Xiao’s relatives had filed a missing persons report but later withdrew it. The police also said that Mr. Xiao had left at “one of Hong Kong’s boundary control points.”
Asked about the possibility that Mr. Xiao had left Hong Kong by boat, the police said in a statement that they were continuing to investigate. Amy Powell, a spokeswoman for the Four Seasons, said the hotel would not comment.
Mr. Xiao’s family members have been allowed to communicate with him, a person close to the family said, adding that his wife is concerned about his heath because he left Hong Kong without his medication for angina and other ailments.
Mr. Xiao’s path to fortune began shortly after he graduated from Peking University, where he enrolled as a child prodigy at age 14. He was head of the official student union and remained loyal to the government even as many of his classmates participated in the pro-democracy protests that ended in a bloody crackdown in June 1989.
As his wealth rose, he entered into various business deals with relatives of the Communist Party elite.
Several companies affiliated with Mr. Xiao were involved in the controversial 2006-7 privatization of Luneng, a huge state-run power company in Shandong Province, in eastern China. Among the others who gained shares was a man named Zeng Ming, according to an exposé published by the investigative magazine Caijing that the Chinese authorities later ordered removed from newsstands.
Overseas Chinese news media later identified Zeng Ming as a pseudonym used by the son of Zeng Qinghong, the former vice president.
In January 2009, one of the Tomorrow Group’s main companies, Baotou Tomorrow Technology, announced that it would pay about $50 million to buy property in southwestern China from a company headed by the son-in-law of the fourth-ranking member of the Communist Party at the time, Jia Qinglin, company records show.
While both Mr. Jia and Mr. Zeng are retired, they have long been seen as important allies of Jiang Zemin, the former president and party leader who continues to wield some influence.
Another prominent Chinese businessman who has taken refuge in Hong Kong to stay out of reach of mainland authorities and spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Xiao’s extraordinary political connections made him an obvious target.
Mr. Xiao, he said, was in a special category.","A Video, a Wheelchair, a Suitcase: Mystery of Vanished Tycoon Deepens","FEB. 10, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/world/asia/xiao-jianhua-hong-kong-disappearance.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,MICHAEL FORSYTHE
"The success or failure of Reckitt Benckiser’s $17 billion deal will be decided in China. Britain’s cleaning-products-to-condoms group is giving $90 a share in cash for the American baby formula-maker Mead Johnson. Cost savings justify only around half of the $3.8 billion premium, though. Making up the balance depends largely on increasing sales in the People’s Republic.
Reckitt Benckiser, valued at $64 billion, unveiled its deal with Mead on Friday, just over a week after confirming that the two were in talks. It expects the tie-up to generate around $250 million of annual cost savings after three full years, mainly by merging the companies’ back offices and driving a harder bargain with suppliers.
Taxed at 25 percent, those savings are worth about $1.9 billion in today’s money — half the value of the 30 percent premium that Reckitt is handing to Mead shareholders. Add the savings onto Mead’s expected earnings for 2020, and the return on Reckitt’s total investment is just over 5 percent — short of the 7 percent cost of capital typical for a large consumer goods group. Reckitt, run by Rakesh Kapoor, says the purchase will exceed its cost of capital after five years. That will depend on increasing sales in the $46 billion global infant nutrition market.
On paper, prospects are bullish. Chinese children will be responsible for around half of the global growth in milk formula sales in the next five years, according to Euromonitor. China’s decision to relax its one-child policy and the increase in women reaching for baby formula as they head out to work should bode well for Mead.
Yet it is also a hugely fragmented market, with around 2,000 baby food brands, many of which are aggressively cutting prices. Food safety scandals have made middle-class buyers in China wary of buying domestically. A government crackdown on informal imports of baby formula via Hong Kong hurt Mead’s sales in Asia in 2016.
The American company is struggling to adapt as new regulations push sales online. Reckitt, which generates nearly a third of its China revenue online, should help to get Mead’s e-commerce offering up to scratch.

"BEIJING — By backing down in a 
 on his promise to review the status of Taiwan, President Trump may have averted a confrontation with America’s most powerful rival.
But in doing so, he handed 
 a victory and sullied his reputation with its leader, 
, as a tough negotiator who ought to be feared, analysts said.
“Trump lost his first fight with Xi and he will be looked at as a paper tiger,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, in Beijing, and an adviser to China’s State Council. “This will be interpreted in China as a great success, achieved by Xi’s approach of dealing with him.”
Mr. Trump’s reversal on Taiwan is likely to reinforce the views of those in China who see him as merely the latest American president to come into office talking tough on China, only to bend eventually to economic reality and adopt more cooperative policies. That could mean more difficult negotiations with Beijing on trade, North Korea and other issues.
At the same time, the Chinese leadership will view statements by Mr. Trump with even greater skepticism. “Even though Trump has said he will support the ‘One China’ policy, China cannot fully trust him,” said Yan Xuetong, dean of the school of international relations at Tsinghua University, in Beijing. “Even his own people don’t trust him.”
China’s official reaction to the telephone call, in which Mr. Trump affirmed that America would abide by the longstanding policy, was polite, even upbeat.
“The conversation was very cordial,” Lu Kang, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said at a regular news briefing on Friday. “The One China principle is the political foundation of China-U.S. relations.”
Under that policy, the United States recognized a single Chinese government in Beijing and severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
American leadership was damaged by Mr. Trump staking out a position and then stepping back, said Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University and the author of “The China Choice,” a book that argues that the United States should share power in the Pacific region with China.
“The Chinese will see him as weak,” Mr. White said of Mr. Trump. “He has reinforced the impression in Beijing that Trump is not serious about managing the U.S.-China relationship.”
Mr. Shi said that Beijing had chosen to remain firm and patient with Mr. Trump, and that approach had paid off.
Even though many other world leaders had spoken to the new American president by phone since his inauguration on Jan. 20, Mr. Xi had refused to talk to Mr. Trump until he was sure that the American president would give what turned out to be a concession — an affirmation of the One China policy, Mr. Shi said.
Mr. Trump put himself in a corner by questioning the status of Taiwan, an issue that the Chinese have regarded as nonnegotiable since President Jimmy Carter put the One China policy into effect in 1979, Mr. Shi added.
Some Chinese said Mr. Trump’s decision to walk back on the issue of Taiwan at least lowered the risk of conflict.
“If he agreed to the One China policy, that means there is no danger of direct war between China and the United States,” said Mr. Yan of Tsinghua University. “That fact is very positive.”
When Mr. Trump took 
 from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan in early December, and said a few days later that he wanted to extract concessions from Beijing in return for keeping the One China policy, the Chinese government issued “ugly” statements saying it would not waver on the issue of Taiwan, Mr. Shi said.
 came from the Foreign Ministry, which said that “it was out of the question” to negotiate and that the One China policy was “a core issue” that involved China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
In diplomatic parlance, that meant Taiwan was a rock-bottom issue that Beijing was prepared to fight over.
The tough statements were intended to recall the time in 1995 when China tested missiles near Taiwan, prompting President Bill Clinton to dispatch an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait, near China’s coast.
China is militarily much stronger today, armed with far more advanced missiles and a more robust navy that includes one aircraft carrier, with more on the way.
The Chinese also decided to flatter Mr. Trump, Mr. Shi said. When the Trump administration started to make small steps to pave the way for the phone call with Mr. Xi, China was almost excessive in its response, a way of trying to reassure Washington without paying any price, Mr. Shi added.
So after Mr. Trump sent a letter to the Chinese Embassy in Washington this week, wishing the Chinese people a “prosperous Year of the Rooster,” Beijing responded that it was “very happy” to receive the president’s greetings.
The American secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, who had pledged to uphold the One China policy during his confirmation hearings, was at the White House on Thursday before the call, apparently pointing out the risks of Mr. Trump’s approach.
“The cost to the U.S. of refusing to recommit to the One China policy was very high, and Trump was persuaded,” said 
, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
In an unusual move, the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua 
 a cheeky quiz on the possible reason Mr. Trump had changed his mind on the One China policy. Twitter is banned in China.
Xinhua gave four choices, giving prominent play to the options “blackmailing didn’t work” and “China’s unyielding stance,” and including the possibility that a visit by Ivanka Trump and her 5-year-old daughter, Arabella, to the Chinese Embassy’s New Year reception last week had played a role.
The tension between Washington and Beijing over Mr. Trump’s attitude toward Taiwan has reverberated around the Asia-Pacific region, where American allies have worried since the December phone call with Ms. Tsai that, in the extreme, there could be armed conflict over Taiwan.
On Friday, the United States Pacific Command said that a Chinese aircraft and an American Navy patrol plane had had an “unsafe” encounter over the South China Sea, The Associated Press reported. A spokesman said that the “interaction” between a Chinese KJ-200 early warning aircraft and a Navy P-3C plane took place on Wednesday in international airspace. The spokesman did not say what was unsafe about the encounter.
That Mr. Trump appears to have smoothed things out for the moment has brought relief, but it does not assuage concerns about future dealings between Mr. Xi and the American president.
Both the White House and the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the two leaders wanted to strengthen cooperation. The White House statement said Beijing wanted to work with Washington on a number of issues, including trade.
Mr. Trump has threatened a trade war by raising the possibility of steep tariffs in response to what he portrays as China’s predatory trade practices.
Neither side specified in their statements how they would cooperate, and doubts remained in the Asia-Pacific region about Mr. Trump’s intentions on a variety of issues. China values predictability, and one phone call could not deliver that, analysts said.
“Trump isn’t attached to any particular policy line with China or anyone else,” said Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “So ‘working together’ could also be dumped whenever it suits.”","Trump, Changing Course on Taiwan, Gives China an Upper Hand","FEB. 10, 2017",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/world/asia/trump-one-china-taiwan.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FChina,JANE PERLEZ
"SHANGHAI — Until he was appointed manager of a Taco Bell in 
, Will Cao had never seen a taco before. When confronted with its hard, U-shaped shell in Los Angeles last June, he wondered: How do you eat it?
“Everything was spilling all over the place,” said Mr. Cao, a 31-year-old Shanghai resident. “Then I looked at the other customers to learn that, actually, you are supposed to tilt your neck to eat it.”
Mr. Cao’s employer is betting that other Chinese diners will figure it out. Yum China, the company behind KFC there, last month opened the first Taco Bell in China in years, and says it plans to open an unspecified number more. The company is turning to double-layered tacos and overstuffed quesadillas in hopes of regaining ground in a market where its fried chicken has shown the limits of its appeal.
It won’t be easy. First, there is the matter of what’s on the menu: Mexican food. Tacos and burritos are virtually unknown in China, where many diners prize aspirational noshes from America, Japan and Europe and look skeptically at what they see as poorer fare from other developing countries.
Then there is Taco Bell’s 
 on Mexican meals. Even among fans, many of its more artery-hardening menu items are best considered late-night guilty pleasures. “It’s like a dirty thing that I love Taco Bell so much,” the actress Anna Kendrick 
 on Conan O’Brien’s talk show, adding, “it has to be under cover of darkness in my car.”
For its new store in Shanghai, Taco Bell is leaving behind some of those greasy American favorites, such as taco shells 
 or 
. Instead, as it once successfully did with KFC, Yum China is tailoring the menu to local tastes. It is offering basic, understandable Tex-Mex fare such as a crunchy taco supreme and a chicken quesadilla. Other dishes made for the Chinese market include a shrimp and avocado burrito and a spicy fried chicken dish, a meal that has broader appeal with the Chinese.
And in a feature rare in America — perhaps for good reason — the China store offers Japanese beer and alcoholic slushes.
Yum China is aware of the magnitude of the challenge. Micky Pant, its chief executive, says eating a taco is “a whole new way of learning.”
The company is learning its own lessons. In the 1990s, Chinese consumers flocked to KFC and other Western fast-food chains, drawn by their clean bathrooms and air-conditioning — a novelty in China at that time. But restaurants like McDonald’s and KFC have since struggled against increasing competition from quick-service Chinese restaurant chains and a shift toward healthier eating.
While China is still a lucrative market for companies including Apple, Nike and Starbucks, other American firms are finding the going tougher than it used to be. The once seemingly insatiable appetite for all things foreign has stalled in a marketplace where domestic brands are catching up and consumers are richer, with more choices than ever.
Big American fast-food chains are now distancing themselves from their China operations. Yum Brands 
 last year, while McDonald’s is selling a controlling stake in its business 
 group.
That led to Yum China’s gamble on Taco Bell. Instead of Taco Bell’s American approach — quick, cheap, often unabashedly junky — the Shanghai restaurant seems intent on easing Chinese diners into ordering. The menu in China features enlarged images of foods on a lighted board and a transparent kitchen, where skeptical customers can watch their food being assembled.
Yum dropped fajitas because focus groups said Chinese people did not like the “peppery type of spiciness that Westerners like,” said Jimmy Chen, senior director of Yum China’s brand development division. Chinese consumers wanted warm cheese on their tacos, not the cold grated variety offered in the United States. They asked for alcohol to be offered.
The bean burrito was “controversial,” Mr. Chen said; while some Chinese who had studied abroad considered it a must, others found two types of starches layered on top of one another unfamiliar. Ultimately the bean burrito was booted.
Said Mr. Chen, “We just need a little more time.”
Yum has tried Taco Bell in China before. In 2003 it opened full-service restaurants called “Taco Bell Grande” in Shanghai, then in the southern city of Shenzhen, offering higher-end fare like steaks and fajitas. But it pulled out five years later.
“They had little Chinese girls with sombreros on them looking ridiculous,” said Joel Silverstein, president of the consultancy East West Hospitality Group and a former senior executive with PepsiCo restaurants, the onetime parent of Yum Brands. “That was a complete disaster.”
Still, Yum once seemed to have cracked the China code. Since opening its first KFC near Tiananmen Square in 1987, Yum has grown into the biggest Western fast-food chain in the country, with more than 7,300 stores in over 1,100 cities, three times that of its rival McDonald’s. Part of the secret was localization: KFC offered fried dough sticks and 
 for breakfast, while its sister brand Pizza Hut served pizzas topped with seafood and durian, a pungent fruit from Southeast Asia.
But in recent years Yum has grappled with a series of 
 in China.
In 2012, Chinese news media reported that KFC chicken suppliers used antibiotics and growth hormones in their meat, news that hurt sales and prompted Yum to cut its number of suppliers. The company emphasized that its food was safe. Two years later, a Chinese state-run broadcaster reported that a meat supplier used by Yum was suspected of selling expired meat. Yum terminated the supplier, which was later fined about $3.5 million by regulators in Shanghai. Sales growth weakened after both episodes, and by 2015 sales at stores that had been open for at least a year continued to decline.
Adding to the decline: an increasingly sophisticated customer base that eschews Western fast food for other options. “The biggest challenge is making the connection with the younger generation,” said Ye Liyan, marketing director in China for Pizza Hut.
In its own effort to refurbish, Pizza Hut is rolling out “concept stores” across China — in Shanghai, one features a robot waiter and a table with a built-in screen for customers to build their own pizzas.
Taco Bell may be an unlikely restaurant to connect. “Chinese people have mostly admired things from Europe and the United States,” said Darcy Zhang, a food blogger based in Shanghai. “But Mexico itself is a developing country, and so many Chinese people would wonder why they would have to try Mexican food.”
Yum China formally opened the Taco Bell on Jan. 9 in Shanghai’s prime Lujiazui area, a popular tourist spot. The former basketball star Shaquille O’Neal, who made the famous “Taco Neck” commercial in 1995, participated in a taco-eating competition.
On a recent Tuesday, the store was packed at lunch, with a 15-minute wait to get a table. Diners sat on chairs below surfboards suspended from ceilings. Workers in polo shirts served margaritas and draft beer.
“If you didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t even know this was Mexican food,” said Zang Jing, 30, a bank clerk, adding that she thought the food was “not bad.”
Liu Xiaoyi, chief editor of a local food guide, said she believed Mexican food could take off in China because people are “willing to try new things.”
“They are willing to listen to people telling them, ‘You have to look at it from a different angle to appreciate it, it’s not the same as a Chinese meal but it’s also delicious,’” she said after photographing her burrito.
Her friend, Zhu Li, disagreed. “It really does not look good when you eat it,” said Ms. Zhu, 45, an insurance agent.
